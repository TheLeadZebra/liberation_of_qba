The Temple of [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Astilabor\|Astilabor]] features a floor mural of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Astilabors Peak/Points of Interest/Astilabor's Peak Mountain\|Astilabor's Peak Mountain]], and a large statue of [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Astilabor\|Astilabor]] stands at the far end of the chapel: A topaz dragon, shimmering with a purple iridescence and an underbelly of gold.

The temple also features a plentiful amount of bookcases filled with books of knowledge. 

The temple was ransacked in recent times by humans, claiming that the draconic god encouraged greed and hoarding of wealth.
