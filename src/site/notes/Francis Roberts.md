King Francis Roberts, a human and often known as 'The Foreign' as a term of endearment, is the current [[The Crown\|Crown]] of the island of [[The Island of Q'ba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]], and the first non-[[Island Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] to hold the title. He is a powerful wizard and the leader of a [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Human]] research expedition which settled on the island over 40 years ago, granted the right to live on the island by [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/Previous Rulers/Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta\|Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta]] who was [[The Crown\|The Crown]] at the time. No findings have been published on their research to this date.

As the leader of the [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Human]] group on the island, he spent a lot of time in discussion with [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/Previous Rulers/Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta\|Greenscale]] and his son, [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta]], with a lot of technological knowlege shared from the [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Humans]] to the island folk. Being closer in age to [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern]] than [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/Previous Rulers/Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta\|Draumur]], a strong bond formed between the two of them and shortly after [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern's]] [[Succession of The Crown\|Succession]], Francis was admitted to [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/The Council of Emperor Ygerdern the Golden\|The Council of Emperor Ygerdern the Golden]], breaking a tradition of the island to form a council of only three members, known as [[The Three\|The Three]]. 

This position only strengthened the friendship between Francis and [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern the Golden]], eventually leading to Francis being chosen as the next [[The Crown\|Crown]] of the island, 11 years ago. A year later, Francis performed his first act that would begin a chain of events, eventually turning his reputation from that of a once revered leader, into a ruthless tyrant. 

The first insance was a raising of taxes for all [[Island Races/Non-Human/Non-Human List\|non-humans]] on the island, including the [[Island Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]]. At the same time 


Tyrant king of [[The Island of Q'ba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]], oppressor of [[Island Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] and [[Island Races/Non-Human/Non-Human List\|Non-Humans]].
