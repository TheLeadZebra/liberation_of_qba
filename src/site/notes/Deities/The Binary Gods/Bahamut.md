Bahamut is the dragon god of enlightened justice (justice tempered with mercy and punishment with forgiveness) and lawful good dragons. 

![Bahamut_holy_symbol.jpg](/img/user/zAttachments/Bahamut_holy_symbol.jpg)
**Symbol** - A platinum dragon profiled against a blue background.
#### Form
His natural form is that of a platinum metallic dragon, approximately 180ft (55ft) in total length, with a tail the same length as his body, said by many to be the only one of his kind. His scales are said to be togher than any shield (some say nearly indestructible) and glow with a feint blue sheen. He also has blue eyes, the exact shade of which shifts depending on Bahamut's mood. Bahamut has been known to wonder the mortal world, taking the appearance of an old human or a demihuman wizard dressed as a peasant accompanied by songbirds. This persona became known among mortals as [[People/Legendary Figures/Fizban the Fabulous\|Fizban the Fabulous]], whom sages believed was designed so  as to not frighten non-dragon beings. The sages also believe that he has many other guises as well.

He is the eternal rival of his sister, [[Deities/The Binary Gods/Tiamat\|Tiamat]], queen of the chromatic dragons. 

#### Alignment
Bahamut is stern and very disapproving of evil, he accepts no excuses for evil acts, and doesn't tolerate even minor offenses by evil creatures. Yet in spite of this stance, he is also considered one of the most compassionate beings in the multiverse. He has limitless empathy for the downtrodden, the dispossessed and the helpless. He usually preferred to polymorph those who had offended him rather than killing them, Bahamut loathed to sully himself with the blood of even evil creatures. 

By draconic standards, Bahamut is neither vain nor desirous of treasure. Instead he values wisdom, knowledge, prophecies, and songs instead. He uses the great wealth he has ammased over the ages in order to help those in need, using the magic items he has gathered to further his goals.

Bahamut also likes to prove the strength and worthiness of his followers by battling them whilst in his dragon form, halting the combat when his followers are injured or overcame him. However he was known to get carried away by his zeal, and had powerful healers on hand in case he gravely injured one of his followers in those battles. 

Bahamut is the antithesis of his sister [[Deities/The Binary Gods/Tiamat\|Tiamat]], as both of them represent opposing values, and this enmity is reflected in the attitude of each deity's worshipers as well.

#### Powers
Those that saw him fight claimed that he had two breath weapons, one a powerful Cone of Cold, the other a vapour which turns his enemies into a gaseous form. A special, third attack is his roar which is so powerful that it can disintergrate creatures or objects within 100ft. If facing off against particularly powerful opponents this roar could still permenantly deafen those who weren't turned to dust. Further he is able to breathe holy winds, which allowed him to heal allies and even resurrect his fallen comrades. He is reputed to know every arcane and divine spell. Bahamut is able to see invisible beings and objects, and can breathe underwater indefinitely. Few things in the mortal world can cause him lasting harm. 

Despite this, Bahamut disdains true combat and prefers to talk with opponents and convince them to surrender using his legendary diplomatic skills. Bahamut speaks many languages, including Draconic, Celestial, Auran, and Common, though he has the ability to talk to any intelligent creature thanks to his ever-present, receptive form of telepathy. 

Whilst Bahamut is able to create Aspects of himself through the willing sacrifice of powerful metallic dragons, he prefers that his dragon worshippers remained dragons rather than sacrifice themselves. However sometimes he has asked a follower to become an aspect when it was needed; to become an emissary, a long-term guardian  or to hunt down evil beings too powerful for  mortal to face.

Occasionally, aspects of Bahamut arise spontaneously on Celestia or a closely related plane. Unlike Bahamut's normal aspects, these spontaneous aspects are short-lived, biological echoes of Bahamut's divine will. These aspects usually faded to nothingness within a day. These aspects were usually the ones who answered the magical summons of Bahamut's worshipers.

According to some sages, aspects of Bahamut physically combined elements of all kinds of metallic dragons, and were big enough to tower even the greatest of the mortal ancient dragons. Aspects of Bahamut were fearless, surprisingly intelligent combatants who cared nothing for their continued existence, something that made them far more dangerous than mortal dragons because of their coldly calculated rage and battle acumen. Aspects of Bahamut usually fought to the death unless their existence was more important than any tactical gain they could get from a battle. Despite this, aspects of Bahamut were more willing to converse with mortals and deal diplomatically with them than most divine aspects, though they only spoke from positions of superiority due to them as representatives of the Platinum Dragon.

#### Followers
The majority of Bahamut's worshipers prior to the Spellplague were metallic dragons. While he was revered by all good dragons, gold, silver, and brass dragons held him in particularly high regard.

Followers of Bahamut often take quests to oppose the schemes of Tiamat and to stop or destroy her followers. They were allies of worshipers of Torm, Moradin, Yondalla, and other lawful good deities.

Bahamut is unable to turn his back on any good creatures that are in need, even if Tiamat isn't involved. Even so, he prefers to help them in indirect ways, such as giving them useful information, needed advice that bordered on prophecy, a safe refuge or healing, and bolstering them with his powerful magic.

Bahamut accepts only clerics of good alignments. Whether they are dragons, dragonborn, half-dragons, or other beings attracted to his philosophy, clerics of the Platinum Dragon must always strive to take constant but subtle actions on behalf of good while trying to do as little harm in the process as possible.

#### Temples
Temples to Bahamut are extremely rare, as the Platinum Dragon doesn't appreciate being honored by objects, taking into account deeds instead. Many gold, silver, and brass dragons maintained small shrines to Bahamut in their lairs, usually nothing more than Bahamut's holy symbol engraved on a wall.

The few temples that were made to honor him were beautiful and elegant buildings with simple furniture and no embellishment or adornment. These temples had meeting rooms where followers could gather to plan their next campaign against Tiamat, and a few smaller rooms where individuals could pray, meditate, or rest in privacy.

#### Rites
Bahamut's worshipers and clergy have no formal rituals or ceremonies. Those who followed the Platinum Dragon believed in the philosophy of "praying through their deeds". The only activity that was considered as something like a ritual was the Rite of Rebirth, the magical process by which non-dragon humanoids transformed themselves into dragonborn.
