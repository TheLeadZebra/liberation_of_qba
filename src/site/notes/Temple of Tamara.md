The Temple of Tamara is a place of worship to [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Tamara\|Tamara]], one of [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/The Four Cardinal Gods\|The Four Cardinal Gods]] of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]]. The temple sits in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]] and is the eastern temple in the cardinal sector. 

Tamara is the god of Life, Mercy, and Forgiveness and this motif fills the large open space. The hall is flooded with coloured light from stained windows dozens of feet overhead, each vibrantly depicting scenes of bardic heroes, children playing, people signing treaties, and generally imagery of nature, including a [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall/Points of Interest/The Arcadian Torrent\|waterfall which appears to flow from the heavens themselves]].

Rows of pews face towards a towering statue depicting [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Tamara\|Tamara]], a wingless green dragon whose scales have burnished edges, whose presnce emits a comforting aura. A large section of carpet before the statue depicts [[Tamara Icon.webp|Tamara's seven-pointed star]].

Most of those who can be found worshiping here are likely to be good aligned, though draconic druids of any alignment may find themselves here whilst visiting the city on other business.
