***[[The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]]*** - Emperor [[The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/Previous Rulers/Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern the Golden]]
*The crown is the ruler of the land, chosen personally by the previous crown upon succession. There are no defined rules of succession, though it is not uncommon for the crown to be passed to kin.*

***[[The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Traditions/The Three\|The Three]]:*** 
**The Overseer of Religious Ceremony** - High Priest Thrumundi the Thunderbound, a Blue Dragon
**The Island Treasurer** - Gullklan Safnara, a Green Dragon
**Envoy to the Common Folk** - Thruumb Hugsi, a White Dragon
The Three are chosen personally by [[The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]], there are no defined roles that [[The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Traditions/The Three\|The Three]] must be made up of, and should a role no longer be required it may be changed whenever suitable, at [[The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]]'s behest. Historically only [[Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] have served on the council of [[The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Traditions/The Three\|The Three]], though this is due to the far greater number of [[Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] living on the island. This has never been a point of contention for the [[Island Races/Non-Human/-Non-Human List\|minor races]] living on [[The Island of Qba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]], who have always considered themselves well treated by the [[Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonfolk]] and without passion for politics

***Secretary to Humanity*** - [[People/Enemies/Francis Roberts\|Francis "The Foreign" Roberts]], A Human
A fourth role, exclusive to [[The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/Previous Rulers/Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern the Golden's]] rule, created as a sign of kinship between [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Humankind]] and [[Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] in return for the technological and cultural significance of their cooperation
