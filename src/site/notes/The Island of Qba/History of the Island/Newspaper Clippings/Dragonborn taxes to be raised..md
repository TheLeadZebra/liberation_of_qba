> A message from King Francis Roberts today reads thus; "Today it is decreed by The Crown that the taxes for non-humans are to be raised. We all understand, on this island of Q'ba - our great home, that humankind has introduced a great many benefits to this island, between technology and medicine alone many great things have been achieved. Of course, this has been recieved with grand gratitude and as such the population of Humans on this island has grown well. This has meant that the burden of any one individual to provide for their kin has been significantly reduced! However, due to this disparity in population between the non-human and human species it has been decided that an unfair portion of taxes is being paid by Humankind, therefore this improved tax system has been introduced in order to imporve the island's equitibility. Glory to Q'ba!"
