300 years ago the city of [[Settlements/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]] was ensnared by a Civil War between [[Factions/Nobles\|Nobles]] and [[Factions/Commoners\|Commoners]]. It is understood that they disagreed over who should have become [[The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]]. Much of the city was destroyed and has since been rebuilt. Only the [[Settlements/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Old Town\|Old Town]] and [[Settlements/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/The Castle\|The Castle]] and surrounding remain mostly in their original forms.

It is believed that after this civil war the island was blessed with the interests of [[Deities/The Binary Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]] and [[Deities/The Binary Gods/Tiamat\|Tiamat]], introducing [[Deities/The Binary Gods/The Binary Gods\|The Binary Gods]] in addition to the already established [[Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/The Four Cardinal Gods\|Four Cardinal Gods]] of the island.
