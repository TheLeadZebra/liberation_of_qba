The mountain of Astilabor's Peak rises high over all else on the island of [[The Island of Qba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]], dwarfing even [[Settlements/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/The Castle\|The Castle]] in the city of [[Settlements/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]]. This mountain is found within the island's region of [[The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Astilabor's Peak\|Astilabor's Peak]], attuned with the element of cold, and the domain of the [[Deities/List of Deities\|List of Deities]] [[Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Astilabor\|Astilabor]]. 

The mountain and it's surrounding landscape are covered with a layer of snow and ice all year round, and it is known that the area is abound with precious gems and metals which are mined by [[Island Races/Non-Human/Dwarf\|Dwarves]] and [[Island Races/Non-Human/Goblin\|Goblins]]. 

At the foot of the southern face of the mountain is the village of [[Settlements/Astilabors Peak/Astilabor's Claw\|Astilabor's Claw]], as well as the mine known as [[The Island of Qba/Landmarks/Astilabor's Peak/Astilabor's Tail\|Astilabor's Tail]].
