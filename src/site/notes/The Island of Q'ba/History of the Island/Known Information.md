# Recent Island History
The Island of Q'ba, settled by Dragonborn many generations ago, they lived in peace. 

The island's geography is of particular note, despite it's size it is home to many biomes important to the Dragonborn - Icy mountains in the north, densly packed forest in the east, a scorching desert, prone to blinding lightning storms sits the south, and acid marshes spread from the western coastline. #Qba #Geography

The Dragonborn have set up a dense city off centre of the island, a well packed city, with buildings rising in height accross the districts, starting low at the entrance and rising, with wealth, towards the main keep. A tall structure with scale-like walls denoting the power of those that sit within it's halls. #Architecture 

Though it is that a Dragonborn Emporer once sat on this throne, this title has been handed down to Humankind. The power the Humankind now have over the island was given willingly by the Dragonborn, for the human's council was great, their trust earned. #History

It was this geography which originally drew the humans to the island, such biomes, all important to the Dragonborn, on such a small island was not impossible but was considered highly improbable. The humans, always interested in claiming strength, considered that these biomes are unlikely to be natural and yet, such terraforming would require immense power, or knowledge now lost to time. The Dragonborn that inhabit this island do not hold the idea of history high in their minds, instead focussing their energy on devotion to the dieties, beheld by them based on their elemental affinities. #Geography #Mystery

Though the Dragonborn are loyal to their own, upon the passing of the crown from Emperor Ygerdern the Goldenheart it was the Human, Francis Roberts; known as
"*The Foreigner*", who was granted the glory of rule. This decision was made with no uncertainty and few slighted Francis - now King. The nickname bestowed upon him, The Foreigner, could easily be mistaken as an insult, pointing out that he is not one from this land but, in fact, it is the opposite; that all he does for this land and that of it's people are despite this not being the homeland of Francis Roberts. King Francis was chosen by Ygerdern because of his loyalty to the Dragonborn people and offered the title King as a sign of great respect for the lands the humans once called home. #History

Though new to the island, the expedition of humans to the island of Q'ba had brought many prosperities. The humans shared their knowledge of crop rotations, disease control and skills in domain expansion to increase the lifestyle of the Dragonborn, improving the islands' self sufficiencies and strengthening their faith with the elements. The humans, too, prospered. With the same such knowledge that they passed down to the Dragonborn, humans expanded to villages spread accross the island and their population boomed. #History 

King Francis was Ygerdern's closest and most trusted advisor. King Francis is a wizard, a skilled student of magic, whose research on the island was very personal. It was this loyalty to the island, and that of Ygerdern which led to the decision of succession, not to a Dragonborn heir, but to Francis. #Francis #Ygerdern
 
With the crown atop head, Francis did not act as he did before. King Frances, once revered for his love of Dragonborn, began his reign of oppression. All Dragonborn who once called themselves Crown Advisor were removed from the castle, replaced by high ranking human commanders. Taxes were steadily increased for Dragonborn specific goods, both traded and imported, on top of increases in payments for market stools and trade houses. These alone led to a financial depression of Dragonborn folk, and an increase in debt from Dragonborn to those of Humankind. 
Quickly, those Dragonborn who were able left the island, but such a sudden depression led to a stranding of many folk on Q'ba. #History #Francis 

In less than a decade, the Dragonborn went from a glorious island nation, to merely workers for a parasite species who stood over them. One the Dragons had called friend. #History 

# Island Biography

Though this is the story of Humans and Dragonborn, there of course exist small communities of other races who, for some reason or other, have their own reason for existing on Q'ba. Take, for example the Dwarves and Goblins who live among the hills and mountains in the north, abundant with resources, deep filles with ores and gemstones. Dryads call the Eastern Forests their home, cultivated by travelling druids who visited the islands, leaving the Seeds of Dryads behind. Besides those who have made themselves a permanent home, the humans developed the main docks of the island to become a trading port bustling with sailing folk of all races who stop at the port for rest from the sea, restock, trade and entertainment.
