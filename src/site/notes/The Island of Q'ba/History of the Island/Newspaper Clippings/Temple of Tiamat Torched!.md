Yesterday a priest of the Temple of Tiamat walked into town and severed the hand of a merchant. Dangling his prize above his head he shouted to the shocked crowd that the actions were "vengeance for that which happened __ #wip years ago, with this we claim our Tribute to the 5 Heads". 

Onlookers were appalled at the event and as the mechants screams continued, a group of Humans spewed aggression at the priest, who was then defended by nearby Dragonborn claiming that the way of the temple was sacred.

It is unclear if the events are linked, but late last night a fire raged through the Temple of Tiamat, destroying it almost completely. At this time there are no known survivors.
