***The Crown*** - Emperor Ygerdern the Golden
*The crown is the ruler of the land, chosen personally by the previous crown upon succession. There are no defined rules of succession, though it is not uncommon for the crown to be passed to kin.*

***The Three:*** 
**The Overseer of Religious Ceremony** - High Priest Thrumundi the Thunderbound, a Blue Dragon
**The Island Treasurer** - Gullklan Safnara, a Green Dragon
**Envoy to the Common Folk** - Thruumb Hugsi (Hoogsi), a White Dragon
*The Three are chosen personally by The Crown, there are no defined roles that The Three must be made up of, and should a role no longer be required it may be changed whenever suitable, at The Crown's behest. Historically only Dragonborn have served on the council of The Three, though this is due to the far greater number of Dragonborn living on the island. This has never been a point of contention for the minor races living on Q'ba, who have always considered themselves well treated by the Dragonfolk and without passion for politics*

***Secretary to Humanity*** - Francis "The Foreigner" Roberts, A Human
*A fourth role, exclusive to Ygerdern the Goldens rule, created as a sign of kinship between Humankind and Dragonborn in return for the technological and cultural significance of their cooperation*
