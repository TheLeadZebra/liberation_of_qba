Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta was a [[Island Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] [[The Crown\|Crown]] of [[The Island of Q'ba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]]. He is the father of [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern the Golden]], previous ruler of the island.
Greenscale was chosen to be [[The Crown\|The Crown]] due to being a hero of the island, when he called upon his [[Deities/List of Deities\|List of Deities]], [[Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Garyx\|Garyx]], in order to create a storm off the coast of the island with the intention of destroying pirate vessels that were performing a siege.
A powerful Cleric, Greenscale followed the [[Deities/List of Deities\|List of Deities]] [[Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Garyx\|Garyx]], despite being a Green Dragon, which are generally associated with [[Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Null\|Null]].
It was during his reign that the [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Humans]] settled on the island. With ships moored off the coast, all that lived south of [[Settlements/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]] were concerned that they were to be besieged, as they were by the pirate invaders. However [[Francis Roberts\|Francis Roberts]], leader of the [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Humans]], came to port in a small boat, as an envoy, and explained that they were here for a research expedition. Under Draumur's command, the [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Humans]] were allowed to come to shore, and after careful logging, were given rights to settle.
He later chose his son to be his [[Succession of The Crown\|Successor]] due to his strong leadership abilities, and powerful empathy with all who live on the island.
