For a map of the Island, see [[Maps/Maps of Q'ba/Map of Q'ba\|here]]. The Island of Q'ba is home to [[Island Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] as a native species, as well as a few other races who have settled upon the island in small numbers over the most recent few hundred years. These races are now split into their own categories of [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Human]] who are very recent settlers, and [[Island Races/Non-Human/Non-Human List\|Non-Human List]] which includes any sentient race that is neither [[Island Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] or [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Human]]. 

The island itself is geographically not very large, and yet contains a wide range of biomes (Frost bound mountains, Acid Marshes, Lushious Forest and Scorching Desert) which split among the cardinal directions of the island. Each of these four directions is it's own [[Maps/Maps of Q'ba/Regions of Q'ba\|Region]], as well as the island's city, [[Settlements/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]], and it's trade port, [[The Island of Q'ba/Island Regions/Kin's Landing\|Kin's Landing]], each being designated their own region.

Q'ba is an independant state, complete with it's own ruler - [[The Crown\|The Crown]], currently [[Francis Roberts\|King Francis Roberts]] who was in charge of a research expedition of [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Humans]] to the island around 40 years ago. This was the first known contact with humans for the island, who were accepted as settlers on the island by [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta]]. Since this time there has been a significant sharing of technology and knowledge, in areas such as building, farming and medicine. This lead to a boom in habitant capacity across the island, especially for the [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Humans]] who now make up the largest portion of population on the island, overtaking even the [[Island Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]].

Q'ba is also known by it's population for the large variety of homebrewed or imported alcoholic beverages, with each region having their own, distinct menus, including each district of [[Settlements/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]]. Further to this, the whole island comes together to serve the same special option, which changes daily.
