The Desert sits in the south eastern corner of [[The Island of Q'ba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]], it is a region known for its blistering sun by day and raging storms at night. The Desert is the domain of [[Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Garyx\|Garyx]], god of Fire, Destruction and Renewal. Often in the centre of The Desert sits [[The Island of Q'ba/Island Landmarks/The Tears of Garyx\|The Tears of Garyx]], an oasis which often dries up in the sun only to be renewed, often in a new location, after a night of powerful storms.

The main inhabitants of The Desert are [[Settlements/The Desert/The Kindred Redhearts\|The Kindred Redhearts]], a nomadic tribe that follows [[The Island of Q'ba/Island Landmarks/The Tears of Garyx\|The Tears of Garyx]] oasis as a place to settle.
