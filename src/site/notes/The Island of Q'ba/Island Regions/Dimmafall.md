The forest region of Dimmafall is known across the island for its beauty across the whole of [[The Island of Q'ba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]]. It is the region bonded with [[Island Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Green Dragonborn]] and tied to the [[Deities/List of Deities\|List of Deities]] [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/The Gods of The Island/The Four Cardinal Gods/Tamara\|Tamara]]. Dimmafall also includes the largest town on the island, [[Kindlewood\|Kindlewood]], which is nestled against the forest as a backdrop, but sits proudly outside of it's boundry. 

The density of the forest combined with the general population of [[Island Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn's]] indifference to documenting the island's history mean that much of it's flora and fauna remins uncatalogued, though more recently small, [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Human]] groups have begun to do so as part of their island research. 

Within the forest dwell an [[Elf\|Elven]] Druid Circle who settled on the island little over 100 years ago after travelling the world, including many [[Far-off Lands\|Far-off Lands]], yet happening upon [[The Island of Q'ba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]] during a rest-stop between known locations. In Dimmafall they found such beauty that they planted seeds of [[Island Races/Non-Human/Dryad\|Dryad]] in honor, and decided to remain on the island.

Rumour has it that within the forest there is a mystical waterfall which flows from thin air and does not flow out of the forest. Yet this has never been documented by any who went looking.

The forest region of Tamara, home to the town of [[Kindlewood\|Kindlewood]] and inhabited by [[Island Races/Non-Human/Dryad\|Dryads]].  The forest has a mystical waterfall which seems to appear from a haze of fog and mist.
