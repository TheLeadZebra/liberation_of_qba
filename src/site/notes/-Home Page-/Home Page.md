# Home Page

Welcome to the Wikisite for The Crown of Thorn, a D&D campaign.

The idea of this site is not so that you will know everything that is coming up, but so that you may know the sort of things your character may know. Use the information here for building a character background, but there's no need to memorise everything, or even anything if that's your preference.

If you feel like it, start here: [[The Island of Qba/History of the Island/Known Information\|Known Information]].

Otherwise, the menu is on the left.

There are a lot of work in progress articles, but I usually fill out at least one a day so far. 
***Obligatory statement that everything is fluid until it hits the table***



>[!note]
>If you find a link that doesn't lead anywhere do let me know, I probably forgot to tag it for publish, but it could be that the page is secret 🤐
