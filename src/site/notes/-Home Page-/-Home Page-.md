# Home Page

Welcome to the Wikisite for The Crown of Thorn, a D&D campaign.

The idea of this site is not so that you will know everything that is coming up, but so that you may know the sort of things your character may know. Use the information here for building a character background, but there's no need to memorise everything, or even anything if that's your preference.

**Character Backstories**: I'm happy to give as much free reign as reasonable here as long as it fits the world. My one main caveat is that you must be wanting to dethrone the tyranical ruler of the island, [[Story/People/Enemies/King Francis Roberts\|King Francis Roberts]], how or why is completely up to you. Further information and more detail will be given during "session Zero's". 

If you feel like it, start here: [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/History of the Island\|History of the Island]]
To learn about the region in which this campaign will take part, ***[[The World/The Island of Qba/Q'ba\|Click Here]]***

Otherwise, the menu is on the left.

There are a lot of work in progress articles, if you would like to know more about a particular topic, let me know.
>[!warning] ***Obligatory statement that everything is fluid until it hits the table***
