# Home Page

Welcome to the Wikisite for The Crown of Thorn, a D&D campaign.

The idea of this site is not so that you will know everything that is coming up, but so that you may know the sort of things your character may know. Use the information here for building a character background, but there's no need to memorise everything, or even anything if that's your preference.

###### Teaser - Welcome to [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]]

To learn about the island as a whole ***[[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|Click Here]]***
To learn more about how the island got to this point *[[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/History of the Island\|Click Here]]*

Otherwise, the menu is on the left.

There are a lot of work in progress articles, if you would like to know more about a particular topic, let me know.
>[!warning] ***Obligatory statement that everything is fluid until it hits the table***
