King's Landing is the Trade port of [[World/The Island of Qba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]] and is itself split into 3 distinct sectors.
Kin's landing is the original name of this location, and is the name that the [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] still use. The name has morphed overtime, through semantic change, by the Humans since [[Story/People/Enemies/King Francis Roberts\|King Francis Roberts]] became [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]], associating it with his rule rather than the spot where the Dragonborn were said to 

Along the shoreline are the Dockyards; filled with warehouses and piers, this is where ships arrive from [[World/The Island of Qba/Far-off Lands\|Far-off Lands]] and have their cargo loaded or unloaded. At the far end of the Dockyards is a Shipwright, home to a master ship-builder and the hub for any repairs or upgrades required on vessels that are docked. 

Behind the Dockyards is the entertainment district, here there are multiple taverns as well as a brothel, gambling fills the pavements and drunkards wonder the paved roads. This is the area where most who are on shore leave spend their time, and their hard earned money.

Running down the side of both of these sectors is the population centre of King's Landing, where many of the workers and traders live. On the border of this sector, and the others, are shops and market stalls where some of the product offloaded from the ships ends up.
