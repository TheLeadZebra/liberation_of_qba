The Desert sits in the south eastern corner of [[World/The Island of Qba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]], it is a region known for its blistering sun by day and raging storms at night. The Desert is the domain of [[World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Garyx\|Garyx]], god of Fire, Destruction and Renewal. Often in the centre of The Desert sits [[World/The Island of Qba/Landmarks/The Desert/The Tears of Garyx\|The Tears of Garyx]], an oasis which often dries up in the sun only to be renewed, often in a new location, after a night of powerful storms.

The main inhabitants of The Desert are [[World/Settlements/The Desert/The Kindred Redhearts\|The Kindred Redhearts]], a nomadic tribe that follows [[World/The Island of Qba/Landmarks/The Desert/The Tears of Garyx\|The Tears of Garyx]] oasis as a place to settle. 

Recently a new town, called [[World/Settlements/The Desert/New Mercy\|New Mercy]], was built along the main road between [[World/Settlements/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]] and [[World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/King's Landing\|King's Landing]] with the aim of reducing the risk of travelling between the two locations.
