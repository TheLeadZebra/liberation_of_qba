Ygerdern was a golden [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]], and a follower of [[World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Garyx\|Garyx]] as his father, [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/Previous Rulers/Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta\|Greenscale]] was before him. 

Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta is the son of the previous [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|Crown]], [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/Previous Rulers/Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta\|Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta]]. Ygerdern was handed [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]] through [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Traditions/Succession of The Crown\|Succession]], though [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/Previous Rulers/Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta\|Draumur]] continued to live for a few years afterwards. Ygerdern was chosen by [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/Previous Rulers/Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta\|Greenscale]] due to being his heir, but moreso because of the bond that Ygerdern had formed with the leader of the [[World/Island Races/Human/Human\|Humans]] who lived on the island, believing this to be a very useful characteristic for the next [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|Crown]].

10 years prior, the [[World/Island Races/Human/Human\|Humans]] had first settled on [[World/The Island of Qba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]] and now, the cooperation between [[World/Island Races/Human/Human\|Human]] and [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] had led the island to a golden age of prosperity. Due to this Ygerdern chose to break from tradition when creating his council of [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Traditions/The Three\|The Three]], installing a fourth member; [[Story/People/Enemies/King Francis Roberts\|King Francis Roberts]] - the leader of the [[World/Island Races/Human/Human\|Humans]] who came to the island as part of a research expedition. 

Further advances on the island thanks to the [[World/Island Races/Human/Human\|Humans]] understanding of technology, agriculture and healing led to greater bonding between Ygerdern and [[Story/People/Enemies/King Francis Roberts\|King Francis Roberts]], eventually leading to Ygerdern passing [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]] to [[Story/People/Enemies/King Francis Roberts\|King Francis Roberts]] upon his death 11 years ago. Ygerdern believed [[Story/People/Enemies/King Francis Roberts\|Francis]] to be a strong leader and ally, and fiercely loyal to the success of the island and all of it's people.
