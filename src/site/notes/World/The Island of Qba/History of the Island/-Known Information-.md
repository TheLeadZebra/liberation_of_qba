#### Recent Island History
The Island of [[World/The Island of Qba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]], settled by [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] many generations ago, they lived in peace. 

The island's geography is of particular note, despite it's size it is home to many biomes important to the [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] - [[World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Astilabor's Peak\|Icy mountains in the north]], [[World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Stillwater Mire\|acid marshes spread from the eastern coastline]], [[World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/The Desert\|a scorching desert which is prone to blinding lightning storms sits the south]], and [[World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall\|densly packed forest in the West]]. 

The [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] have set up a dense city off centre of the island, [[World/Settlements/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]], a well packed city, with buildings rising in height accross the districts, starting low at the entrance and rising, with wealth, towards the main keep, [[World/Settlements/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/The Castle\|The Castle]]. A tall structure with scale-like walls denoting the power of those that sit within it's halls. 

Though it is that a [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|Emporer]] that once sat on this throne, this title has been handed down to [[World/Island Races/Human/Human\|Humankind]]. The power the [[World/Island Races/Human/Human\|Humankind]] now have over the island was given willingly by the [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]], for the his council was great, their trust earned. 

The nature of the island's regions is that which originally drew the humans to the island, such biomes, all important to the [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]], on such a small island was not impossible but was considered highly improbable. The [[World/Island Races/Human/Human\|humans]], always interested in claiming strength, considered that these biomes are unlikely to be natural, but such terraforming would require immense power, or knowledge now lost to time. The [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] that inhabit this island do not hold the idea of history high in their minds, instead focussing their energy on devotion to the deities, beheld by them based on their elemental affinities. 

Though the [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] are loyal to their own, upon the passing of the crown from Emperor [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/Previous Rulers/Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta]] it was the [[World/Island Races/Human/Human\|Human]], [[Story/People/Enemies/Francis Roberts\|Francis Roberts]]; known as "*The Foreigner*", who was granted the glory of rule. This decision was made with no uncertainty and few slighted Francis - now King. The nickname bestowed upon him, The Foreigner, could easily be mistaken as an insult, pointing out that he is not one from this land but, in fact, it is the opposite; that all he does for this land and for it's people are despite this not being the homeland of [[Story/People/Enemies/Francis Roberts\|Francis Roberts]]. [[Story/People/Enemies/Francis Roberts\|King Francis]] was chosen by [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/Previous Rulers/Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern]] because of his loyalty to the [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] people and offered the title King as a sign of great respect for the lands the humans once called home. 

Though new to the island, the expedition of [[World/Island Races/Human/Human\|humans]] to the island of [[World/The Island of Qba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]] had brought many prosperities. The [[World/Island Races/Human/Human\|humans]] shared their knowledge of crop rotations, disease control and skills in territorial expansion to increase the lifestyle of the [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]], improving the islands' self sufficiency and strengthening their faith with the elements. The [[World/Island Races/Human/Human\|humans]], too, prospered. With the same such knowledge that they passed down to the [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]], [[World/Island Races/Human/Human\|humans]] expanded to villages spread across the island and their population boomed. 

[[Story/People/Enemies/Francis Roberts\|King Francis]] was [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/Previous Rulers/Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern's]] closest and most trusted advisor. [[Story/People/Enemies/Francis Roberts\|King Francis]] is a wizard, a skilled student of magic, whose research on the island was very personal. It was this loyalty to the island, and that of [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/Previous Rulers/Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern]] which led to the decision of [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Traditions/Succession of The Crown\|Succession]], not to his son, [[Story/People/Legendary Figures/Leifr Funahjarta\|Leifr Funahjarta]], but to [[Story/People/Enemies/Francis Roberts\|Francis]], despite [[Story/People/Legendary Figures/Leifr Funahjarta\|Leifr's]] leadership qualities.

As [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]], [[Story/People/Enemies/Francis Roberts\|Francis]] did not act as he did before. [[Story/People/Enemies/Francis Roberts\|King Francis]], once revered for his love of [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]], began his reign of oppression. All Dragonborn who once called themselves [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Councils/The Council of Emperor Ygerdern the Golden\|The Council of Emperor Ygerdern the Golden]] were removed from the castle, replaced by high ranking [[World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Councils/The Council of King Francis Roberts\|human commanders]]. Taxes were steadily increased for [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] specific goods, both traded and imported, on top of increases in payments for market stools and trade houses. These alone led to a financial depression of [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] folk, and an increase in debt from [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] to those of [[World/Island Races/Human/Human\|Humankind]].  Quickly, [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] who were able left the island, but such a sudden depression led to a stranding of many folk on [[World/The Island of Qba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]]. 

In less than a decade, the [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] went from a glorious island nation, to merely workers for a parasite species who stood over them. One the [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] had called friend. 

# Island Biography

Though this is the story of [[World/Island Races/Human/Human\|Human]] and [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]], there of course exist small communities of other races who, for some reason or other, have their own reason for existing on [[World/The Island of Qba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]]. Take, for example the [[World/Island Races/Non-Human/Dwarf\|Dwarves]] and [[World/Island Races/Non-Human/Goblin\|Goblins]] who live among the hills and mountains in the north, abundant with resources, deep filles with ores and gemstones. [[World/Island Races/Non-Human/Dryad\|Dryads]] call the Eastern Forests their home, cultivated by travelling [[World/Island Races/Non-Human/Elf\|Elven]] druids who visited the islands, leaving the [[World/Island Races/Non-Human/Dryad\|Seeds of Dryads]] behind. Besides those who have made themselves a permanent home, the humans developed the main docks of the island to become a trading port now called [[World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Kin's Landing\|Kin's Landing]] which bustles with sailing folk of all races who stop at the port for rest from [[World/The Island of Qba/Far-off Lands\|Far-off Lands]] to restock, trade and for entertainment. 

# Island Deities

The native [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] have their own gods on the island, known as [[World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/-The Four Cardinal Gods-\|-The Four Cardinal Gods-]].

Each of [[World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/-The Four Cardinal Gods-\|The Four]] rule over a region of the island:
- [[World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Astilabor\|Astilabor]] - [[World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Astilabor's Peak\|Astilabor's Peak]]
- [[World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Garyx\|Garyx]] - [[World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/The Desert\|The Desert]]
- [[World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Null\|Null]] - [[World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Stillwater Mire\|Stillwater Mire]]
- [[World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Tamara\|Tamara]] - [[World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall\|Dimmafall]]

In recent history the island has also been blessed with the presence of [[World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]] and [[World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Tiamat\|Tiamat]] also, known here as [[World/Deities/The Binary Gods/-The Binary Gods-\|-The Binary Gods-]].

The [[World/Island Races/Human/Human\|Humans]] also brought with them their own god, [[World/Deities/Human Gods/Ilmatar\|Ilmatar]], who stands for them as a beacon of hard work despite pain or difficulty. This symbolism has been corrupted by many as justification for exploiting the [[World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] and other [[World/Island Races/Non-Human/-Non-Human List\|Non-Humans]] of the island.
