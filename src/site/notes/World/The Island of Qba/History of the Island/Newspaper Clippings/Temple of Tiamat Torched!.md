>Yesterday a priest of the Temple of Tiamat, who has been named as Karrig, walked into town and severed the hand of a merchant. Dangling his prize above his head he shouted to the shocked crowd that the actions were "vengeance for that which happened 8 years ago, with this we claim our Tribute to the 5 Heads". 

>Onlookers were appalled at the event and as the merchant's screams continued, a group of Humans spewed aggression at the priest who was then defended by another nearby Dragonborn claiming that the way of the temple was sacred and right.

>It is unclear if the events are linked, but late last night a fire raged through the Temple of Tiamat, destroying it almost completely. At this time there are no known survivors.
