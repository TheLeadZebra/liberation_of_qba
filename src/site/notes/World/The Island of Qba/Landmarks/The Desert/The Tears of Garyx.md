The Tears of Garyx is the name of an Oasis in [[World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/The Desert\|The Desert]], near which [[World/Settlements/The Desert/The Kindred Redhearts\|The Kindred Redhearts]] choose to settle. The oasis itself often dries up in the heat of the desert sun, only to be renewed elsewhere during the nightly storms.
