##### Week days: 
1. Moonday - The night transitioning between the end of one season and the start of the next marks the beginning of celebration.
2. Choresday - A standard workday, often the first full day of work of the year, or any month beginning a new season, when celebrations concluding the night before.
3. Wealthday - Generally the day for salaries to be paid to workers, whether monthly or weekly. The last Wealthday of the year is also the day for any annual bonus payments, as well as the day taxes are reported.
4. Fairsday - The second Fairsday of every month marks a day where wealthier patrons visit the bustling markets around the city and ports. Street performers come out for the busiest time of the month with hopes of entertaining the masses.
5. Fireday - The last day of the working week, often people gather together around fires to socialise, beginning the weekend.
6. Starday - The most common day for worship, expected for there to be fewer people working on this day than previous weekdays.
7. Sunday - A day of rest. Many people do not work on Sundays, shops may also close earlier to account for this.

Commonly Starday is associated with worship, and Sunday is a day of rest. It is common for the rest of the days to be considered the 'working days' of the week.

Each day of the week occurs on the same date every month as well as every year due to being divided into seven.

For example, Moonday is always the first day of the year, and of any given month. In the same way, Sunday is always the twenty-eighth (last) day of every given month, and also the last day of the three hundred sixty four day year.
