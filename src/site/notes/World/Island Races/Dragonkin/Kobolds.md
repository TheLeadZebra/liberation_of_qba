Kobolds are small dragonkin. Living on the western ridge of the island, along [[World/Settlements/Dimmafall/Kobold Cove\|Kobold Cove]] they keep to themselves. Noted for their siills in trap bulding and preparing ambushes, they are generally aggressive creatures distantly related to Dragons. They appear as humanoid reptiles between 2-2.5ft tall with scaled skin of reddish brown to black in colour with a burnt orange to red eye colour. 

Resentful of their short stature despite their titanic ancestry, they hate members of other races that make fun of their small size. Often they compensate for their small size through humor or aggression. Naturally they tend to dislike taller creatures.

They consider the Goddess [[World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Tiamat\|Tiamat]] to be their creator, though they do not worship her.
