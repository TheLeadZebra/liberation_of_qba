New Mercy is the newest settlement on the island, put together very quickly with somewhat flimsy looking wooden buildings. The town is built along the singular long road running between [[World/Settlements/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]] and [[World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/King's Landing\|King's Landing]], with buildings split either side of the road. 

The aim of the town was to generally improve defences and create a quicker response to potential caravan attacks along this critical route.
