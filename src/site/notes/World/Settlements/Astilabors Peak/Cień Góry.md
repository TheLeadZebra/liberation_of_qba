Cień Góry is the most northern settlement on the island of [[World/The Island of Qba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]], with less than two dozen citizens. 

The tiny population consists entirely of [[Goliath\|Goliath]] whose industry focusses mostly on farming natural ice. The ice is considered a commodity for the few people, generally of noble origin, who are unwilling to consume magical ice.

The [[Goliath\|Goliath]]s survive almost exclusively on caught fish.
