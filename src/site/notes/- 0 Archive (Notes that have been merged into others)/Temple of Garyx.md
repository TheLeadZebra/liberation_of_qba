*(Image to evoke a feeling, not completely accurate to the real location)*


Prior to it's ironic destruction during a riot against "corrupt draconic gods", the temple of [[- 0 Archive (Notes that have been merged into others)/Garyx\|Garyx]] was a simple chamber set within a canyon created by a magically induced earthquake. At the end of the canyon was a huge firepit. Followers of [[- 0 Archive (Notes that have been merged into others)/Garyx\|Garyx]] would feed this neverending fire with scrolls denoting bad deeds, from which they believed the destruction of these scrolls cleansed them off their wrongdoings. 

Other items would also be fed to the flames, depending on a dragons own wants, needs for, or ideas about, cleansing, renewal or rebirth.
