*(Image to evoke a feeling, not completely accurate to the real location)*

The temple of [[- 0 Archive (Notes that have been merged into others)/Null\|Null]] is a unique building. Dead bodies lie neatly throughout the temple, the smell of decay soaked into every pore of stone, wood, or any other materials used in its construction. The main chambers of the temple are underground with no natural light, only dim candles light the spaces between corpses in which to move between. 

The far side of the chamber is slightly raised on a dais, here the shape of the draconic [[- 0 Archive (Notes that have been merged into others)/Null\|Null]] is formed from impenetrable blackness.

Followers of [[- 0 Archive (Notes that have been merged into others)/Null\|Null]] who are about to die, especially of draconic ancestry, find their way here in their final moments bringing with them any treasures or items they cannot bear to part with.

The temple of [[- 0 Archive (Notes that have been merged into others)/Null\|Null]] has been sealed to avoid the risk of the dead being disturbed by a potential ransacking as with many of the other [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]] temples in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]].
