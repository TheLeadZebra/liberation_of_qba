A tavern is a [[Store\|Store]] which specialises in the sale of hospitality. It is exceedingly common for a tavern to sell [[Definitions/Consumables/Alcohol\|Alcohol]] and [[Food\|Food]] to it's clientele, and often times there are areas available for entertainment; for example gambling on card games, or brawling.

An inn provides similar experiences to a tavern, with the ability to also stay there overnight in a rented bed or room. It is not uncommon for such a place to either be of a larger size, or provide fewer options to account for the extra space required. A Tavern may instead contain boarding, low quality bunking in dormitories for people who can only afford the cheapest of accommodation, or who intend to stay long-term, for example whilst looking for work.
