With the Hide action, you try to hide yourself. To do so, you must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check while you’re [[zzSRD/04) Backlink Glossary/Rules/Heavily Obscured\|Heavily Obscured]] or behind [[zzSRD/04) Backlink Glossary/Rules/Three-Quarters Cover\|Three-Quarters Cover]] or [[zzSRD/04) Backlink Glossary/Rules/Total Cover\|Total Cover]], and you must be out of any enemy’s line of sight; if you can see a creature, you can discern whether it can see you.

On a successful check, you have the [[zzSRD/04) Backlink Glossary/Conditions/Invisible\|Invisible]] condition while hidden. Make note of your check’s total, which is the DC for a creature to find you with a Wisdom (Perception) check.

You stop being hidden immediately after any of the following occurs: you make a sound louder than a whisper, an enemy finds you, you make an attack roll, or you cast a spell with a Verbal component.
