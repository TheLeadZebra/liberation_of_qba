### Nix Appears
>(Have Abbie describe [[The World/People of the World/Player Characters/Companions/Nix the Raven\|Nix]])
>Nix, your friend from [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall/Settlements/Circe\|Circe]], stands before you. They tilt their head slightly before letting out a squark, they are clearly happy to see you.
>Almost immediately your mind is rushed with thoughts and memories.
>You realise they belong to Nix.
>A telepathic bond has formed and suddenly you are looking through they eyes of Nix, seeing what they see.
>Remembering.
>You're back in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall/Settlements/Kindlewood\|Kindlewood]], you watch yourself, Faelwyn, get knocked unconscious and that one, they are going to kill her! You swoop down in Faelwyn's defence. Pecking, swiping.
>"Fucking druids!"
>You see it too late, something hard hits you and you fall to the ground.
>...
>The memories continue.
>You, Nix, are floating on your back. ***blink*** Clumps of matter and balls of light stare back at you as you look on into the endless void. ***blink*** You feel waves rolling over your feathers, but when you look around it is not water, but a sea of dust. ***blink*** The rolling of the waves almost sounds like a gentle breeze across a valley. ***blink***
>It is the only sound, and you focus on it to distract you from the buzzing. ***blink*** The constant buzzing. ***blink*** Everywhere. ***blink*** all around you. ***blink***. ***Incessant***. *Buzzing*. ***blink***
>How long has it been? It feels like a day, and decades at the same time.
>You blink. 
>This time when you open your eyes, you are somewhere else. A city, like Drakenholm, but strange. 
>You're certainly on an island, so you look around for a landmark expecting to see [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#The Castle\|The Castle]] but the thing that catches your eye is a huge, wrought iron structure over 300 metres in size.
>Four legs in a square, arch upwards to meet in the shape of an A. You imagine how it would look standing upright, but this tower looks as though an incredibly strong wind has blown the tower over, bending to almost 90°.
>At the edge of an enormous stretch of water is the city docks looking out towards land miles off in the distance, and a *huge* statue of a woman. She sits on the ground with her face buried into her arms. White hair draped down, covering her entire body. Behind her, a towering stone monolith features a number, which looks as though it has been brushed on with lightning: ***41***.

### Nix Hungers
> Where is all the green in a place like this? You've never felt hunger like this. Green is worms and worms help hunger.
> You haven't eaten since yesterday, or last year, or maybe it was centuries ago. Either way you are so hungry you can barely even flap your wings. But you have to search.
> Nothing in the north, east, the south or the west. This city looks like it has been broken apart and thrown as far away from green as it possibly could. It is too far to fly across the water, but there is no other choice.
> You must try.
> You flap towards the docks and each flap of your wings is more difficult than the last. But you aim for the ***41*** and you flap. You flap until your flaps can't hold you in the air anymore, and you begin to drop.
> ***Plap***
> You lie motionless on the floor at the edge of the docks, until you gain the energy to move into a sat position and you stare out to the woman. With the fuzziness of your vision now, you could swear that the statue moved...
> "Oh you poor little birdy, come here" a girls voice from behind you says. You try to turn your head but can't summon the strength. "Let's help you feel better, shall we?" You feel yourself get scooped up by warm, loving hands 'Faelwyn? Is that you?' you think to yourself, but no. This is a new face. "Oh daddy, daddy, can we feed them the fishes that we caught?" the girl bounces with excitement. 
> Her father chuckles, "Okay, but only one. We need to feed ourselves too, Daisy"
---
### Nix Searches
> You're searching for Daisy, she must be around here somewhere. You've already checked her favourite candy shop and that blanket fort daddy made for her in the back garden. It's going to be dark soon and Ma said she can't be out when it's dark outside.
> Finally you find her backed against a wall in an alley. 2 boys, around 8 years old are talking to her. You've seen them in the same class at school. You perch nearby to find out what is going on.
> "Eww, your dad is 40? That is so old! You must be really sad. My mum gave birth when she was 18, we're going to be together forever!" says one of the boys.
> "Shut up Francois, you're being really mean."
> "Nu-uh Daisy, your mum is the meanie and one day-"
> Daisy pushes Francois, who immediately punches her in the face.
> Blood begins to drip out of Daisy's nose, as she starts crying while Francois and his companion begin laughing to themselves.
> Daisy tries to run, but Francois grabs her arm.
> You realise you have to do something, you can't let Daisy die like you let Faelwyn.
> You screech as loud as you can as you swoop down, slashing at the boys with your talons.
> "Nix!" Daisy is surprised by your arrival, happy to see you. 
> Francois' grip tightens to keep a hold of Daisy's arm so this time, as you swoop, you grasp onto his chest and start pecking, making sure you don't stop until he lets go.
> Daisy runs off down the alley, and you make sure to follow, the taste of blood still on your tongue...

### Nix Leaves
>"Out!"
>"Daddy, please, no!"
>"I said, **OUT**!"
>"Nix was just trying to help, it wasn't their fault, it was Fran-"
>"It's dangerous Daisy, a wild animal. We can't keep it here.", he swooshes his arms gently towards you. "I know you can hear me. *Get. OUT!*"

### Nix Watches
> Today is the day of the party! Since you got here a week ago, you've seen them preparing. People have spent hours every day harvesting the flowers and picking all the red and white petals which now coat the streets to the point that the stone paving is barely even visible. 
> The crowd are migrating towards the docks where thousands of people have already gathered. Around the docks the petals of the ***Red Gerbera Daisies*** are so numerous they create piles along the pavements. Among the thousands in the crowd, a few hundred are standing on the edge of the docks in fine suits and silken dresses. A thick fog blocks the view across the water, yet many people stand silently looking out whilst their feet desperately shuffle.
> Off to the side, ships are loaded with boxes of supplies under the watch of serious looking individuals in black robes, each wearing matching golden sashes tied around the top of their arm.
> Your ears latch on to a familiar voice, Daisy is in the crowd reaching towards the dock desperately but being held back by a number of adults.
>You can see her screaming words but her voice has been drowned out by the simultaneous gasp of a thousand individuals as the fog splits apart, revealing the lady statue standing, a paintbrush in hand. Paint drips from the tip, like lightning striking the earth.

### Nix Arrives
>The woman stands across the water, staring back at the thousands at the dockside, in a cacophony of silence.
>She steps to the side and looks towards the monolith and, in an instant, strikes away the number 41. Then, with intention, she lifts her brush to the rock face and replaces the number:
>***40***
>Almost at once, boos, jeers and aggressive shouts are directed across the water, and just as quickly it falls back to silence. Daisy uses the distraction to wriggle free, running towards Daddy, stood on the edge of the dock.
>You look to Daddy as Ma kisses him, even from this rooftop you can see the tears glint in the sunlight.
>As Daisy rushes towards him Ma grabs around his chest, burying her face tightly. Daisy clutches onto his leg just in time.
>Daddy and Ma crouch down to Daisy, linking all their arms together, as Daddy's form fades leaving a plume of red, white and black petals where he once kneeled.
>...
>You watch on as hundreds share the very same fate, all surrounded by loved ones; their friends and their families.
>The plumes of petals rise up into the sky.
>Another plume, much closer begins to fill your vision as the city disappears into blackness.
>...
>Only a few seconds pass before the light returns, but this time you are not in the city watching petals. Instead you are looking into the face of a friend.
>Faelwyn?
>You're not sure you even believe your eyes anymore, but you catch yourself with a deep breath and a tilted head -
>"Squaaark"
