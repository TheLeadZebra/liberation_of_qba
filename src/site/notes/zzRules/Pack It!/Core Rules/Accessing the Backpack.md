#### Failed to prepare? Not prepared to fail? Don't worry, there is still hope.

Is the BBEG resistant to bludgeoning and you only equipped your warhammer? Unfortunately it's going to take some time to fix it, but worry not because you have now created a decision for yourself and we all know that making decisions is the true fun in Tabletop RPGs.

Of course you can spend your time flailing your hammer about and having your abilities make up the short fall, or you could take your backpack off and start rummaging.

Accessing your backpack does take quite a long time, and a lot of focus however. As such in order to do so you must make the Use Action, as well as spending either your Bonus Action or your entire Move Speed. Doing so will allow you to either place one item into ***or*** take one item out of your backpack.  

If you wish to both place one item into the backpack as well as take one item out, you may do so as long as it is the only thing you do on your turn.

You may access another character's backpack to remove one item, or place one item in, as an Action. 
If you wish to both place one item into the backpack as well as take one item out, you may do so by spending an Action and a Bonus Action.
