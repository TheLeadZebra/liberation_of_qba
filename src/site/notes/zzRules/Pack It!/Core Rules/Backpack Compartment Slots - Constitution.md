#### ***A weighty backpack requires a sturdy frame to bear its load.***

##### Backpack Compartments
To an adventurer, their backpack is as important to them as their lifeblood. The more items they can hold in their backpack, the more prepared they will be, and the more items they can bring back to town for a tidy profit.  

But, not all backpacks are made equal, and some are able to hold quite an abundance of items. Such a backpack would be unwieldy and tiring to carry for long periods, hence they would need to be carried by someone with a good constitution.  

Any character can carry a backpack with a minimum of 6 Backpack Compartments, plus an additional compartment per Constitution modifier, up to nine Backpack Compartments in total.

Each Backpack Compartment can hold a number of items, depending on the size of the items and the size of the character, as described below.

##### Compartment Spaces
The size of a Backpack Compartment is dependant on the creature size. For a Small or Medium creature a Backpack Compartment contains 6 Compartment Spaces. For every creature size larger a Backpack Compartment doubles in Compartment Spaces, compared to the previous creature size. For each creature size smaller a Backpack Compartment size halves its Compartment Spaces.  
**Tiny - 3 Compartment Spaces**  
**Small or Medium - 6 Compartment Spaces**  
**Large - 12 Compartment Spaces**  
**Huge - 24 Compartment Spaces**  
**Gargantuan - 48 Compartment Spaces**

##### Item sizes
Items of different sizes or weights require different amounts of space to fit within a Backpack Compartment.  
The size of an item should be decided by the table, with the DM having the final say. When determining the size of an item consideration should be given to the size and also the weight of the item.

These items can be described by the following categories:  
**Trinket - negligible space used** (tiny single items, lockets, gems, featherweight items etc)  
**Small - 1 Compartment Space** (A candle, quite light items etc) 
**Medium - 3 Compartment Spaces** (A shoebox, fairly weighty items etc)  
**Large - 6 Compartment Spaces** (A small painting, somewhat heavy items etc)  
**Oversized - Cannot fit in backpack, or very heavy**. If an item requires more spaces than a Backpack Compartment holds, this item cannot be placed into the backpack. Such items must be carried by hand, if they could even be liftable at all. (e.g an anvil, or a small anvil etc)  
The given Item Sizes should be considered a guide, a Huge creature for example may be able to carry items in their Backpack Compartments which may be unreasonable for creatures of other sizes to even pick up.

So long as enough space remains within a Backpack Compartment, any number of items can be placed within.


##### Adding Flavour
Some players may not enjoy the image of their character always carrying around a full backpack, especially a full sized hiking backpack.  
In cases like these consider that a long coat may contain a selection of pockets, combined with a smaller messenger bag.  
On the other hand a halfling's player may enjoy the image of carrying a wheelbarrow around with them.


##### Backpack Compartments Rule at a Glance
A character has a total of 6+(Con. mod) Backpack Compartments.  
Each Backpack Compartment contains 6 Compartment Spaces (for a Small or Medium creature).  
The number of Compartment Spaces required to store an item is dependant on the Item Size.
