#### ***The heft of a haft should not be misjudged.***

##### Weapon Slots
Every character has up to a total of five slots in which they may store weapons. As a Free Action, per hand any stored weapon may be sheathed ***and*** drawn. Any weapon which is not stored in a Weapon Slot must be stored in a backpack, which is difficult to access during combat.

All characters have two Weapon Slots, plus an additional Weapon Slot per Strength modifier, up to a maximum of five.

Any weapon may be stored in a Weapon Slot, with some additional rules:
- *A weapon with the Light property does not weigh as much as most other weapons, two may fit into a single Weapon Slot. This may only occur once per character.*
- *A weapon with the thrown property is narrower than most weapons, three may fit into a single Weapon Slot. This may only occur once per character.*


##### Adding Flavour
Weapon Slots can be described however a player may wish in order to fit the flavour of their character.

Examples of weapons slots may be as follows: 


A ***travelling Fighter*** might have weapon sheaths such as - *Left Belt - [[zzRules/Basic Rules (SRD)/04) Backlink Glossary/Equipment/Weapons/Martial Melee/Longsword\|Longsword]], Right Belt - 3 [[zzRules/Basic Rules (SRD)/04) Backlink Glossary/Equipment/Weapons/Simple Melee/Handaxe\|Handaxe]]s, Back 1 - [[zzRules/Basic Rules (SRD)/04) Backlink Glossary/Equipment/Weapons/Martial Melee/Warhammer\|Warhammer]], Back 2 - Empty and, Backpack Sling* - Empty.  
A ***prowling Rogue assassin*** may have more secretive sheaths: Underarm - 2 [[zzRules/Basic Rules (SRD)/04) Backlink Glossary/Equipment/Weapons/Simple Melee/Dagger\|Dagger]]s, Inside Pocket - 3 [[zzRules/Basic Rules (SRD)/04) Backlink Glossary/Equipment/Weapons/Simple Ranged/Dart\|Dart]]s, Lower Back -  Empty, Left Belt - Empty, Right Boot - Empty.  

Whilst the Weapon Slots for each of these characters are mechanically identical, labelling them in this manner gets the players to imagine how and where *their* character may wear their weapons.



##### Weapon Slots Rule at a Glance
A character has a total of 2+(Str. mod) Weapon Slots.  
One Weapon Slot per character may hold 2 weapons with the Light Property.  
One Weapon Slot per character may hold 3 weapons with the Thrown Property.
