Consider instead that Bottle Slots are Wisdom based only.

This would open up a character to instead be skilled in storing Spell Scrolls. This is a situation which is less likely to be relevant, however, sometimes putting a 'limitation' on something can remind a player that such a mechanic exists. 

If you wish to use this mechanic the rule would follow similarly to other rules:
*Any character has Spell Scroll Slots equal to 2+(Int. mod), up to a maximum of 5.*
