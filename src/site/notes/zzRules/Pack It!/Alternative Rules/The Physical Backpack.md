Under the core rules, the backpack which contains the Backpack Compartments is essentially considered incorporeal.

By this it is meant that a character will always have ***their*** backpack, and this backpack has a specific number of Backpack Compartments and Compartment Size, this should be considered a hard stop, the backpack cannot be overfilled. 

An alternative to this rule could be that any character has access to backpacks of all sizes, be they purchasable from a store, gifts from another creature, or crafted.

Alternatively perhaps individual Backpack Compartments can be added to a backpack, or coat etc.

For such a scenario, you should note the maximum number of filled Backpack Compartment Spaces the character can carry. If the character increases their filled Backpack Compartment Spaces above this amount then they should be considered ***Encumbered***, and any effects should be applied as per the rule book.
