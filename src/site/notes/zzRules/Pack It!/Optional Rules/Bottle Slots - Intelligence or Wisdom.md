As with weapons, any potions or other vials can be stored within a backpack, but access during combat should be difficult. Therefore, a prepared character will store required items within reach in areas called Bottle Slots.

Every character has a maximum of five Bottle Slots in which they may store their bottles, these are in addition to any Weapon Slots or Backpack Compartment Slots. Using these potions still requires an Action/Bonus Action as stated in the item's rules.

All characters have access to two Bottle Slots, plus an additional Bottle Slot per Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (whichever is the highest), up to a maximum of five. A Bottle Slot may only hold one bottle, regardless of its type - Potion, Vial etc.
