Characters with a high Charisma love to share stories. By doing so they have often heard some kind of method another adventurer swears by to improve their preparedness. These methods can be passed on to other characters for their own benefit.

As such, any character may provide a character, other than themselves, with an Advice Slot. An Advice Slot is exchanged by the receiving character for an extra Slot of any other kind. The Advice Slot cannot put a character above the maximum allowance of that Slot kind.

Any character has a number of Advice Slots equal to their Charisma Modifier, up to a maximum of three.

Often people will revert to their habitual ways, because of this you may take back an Advice Slot at any time after at least five days have passed. The benefits that this Advice Slot provided to the character are immediately lost.
