Each type of ammunition ***must*** be stored in some kind of ammunition holder. Consider an arrow quiver, bolt case, or bullet pouch for example. In this system these are referred to as Ammunition Bearing Slots.

Any character is able to use an Ammunition Bearing Slot to store fifteen ammunition, plus an additional five ammunition per Dexterity modifier, up to a maximum of thirty in total.

An Ammunition Bearing Slot must replace either a Weapon Slot or Backpack Compartment, decided by the player.

An Ammunition Bearing Slot may only hold one type of ammunition at a time, though the quality and effects of that ammunition may be mixed. For example, magical and non-magical arrows may be placed into the same quiver, but arrows and bolts may not.
