## Core Rules

### Weapon Slots - Strength
#### ***The heft of a haft should not be misjudged.***

###### Weapon Slots
Every character has up to a total of five slots in which they may store weapons. As a Free Action, per hand any stored weapon may be sheathed ***and*** drawn. Any weapon which is not stored in a Weapon Slot must be stored in a backpack, which is difficult to access during combat.

All characters have two Weapon Slots, plus an additional Weapon Slot per Strength modifier, up to a maximum of five.

Any weapon may be stored in a Weapon Slot, with some additional rules:
- *A weapon with the Light property does not weigh as much as most other weapons, two may fit into a single Weapon Slot. This may only occur once per character.*
- *A weapon with the thrown property is narrower than most weapons, three may fit into a single Weapon Slot. This may only occur once per character.*


##### Adding Flavour
Weapon Slots can be described however a player may wish in order to fit the flavour of their character.

Examples of weapons slots may be as follows: 


A ***travelling Fighter*** might have weapon sheaths such as - *Left Belt - [[zzRules/DnD 5.5e Rules/04) Backlink Glossary/Equipment/Weapons/Martial Melee/Longsword\|Longsword]], Right Belt - 3 [[zzRules/DnD 5.5e Rules/04) Backlink Glossary/Equipment/Weapons/Simple Melee/Handaxe\|Handaxe]]s, Back 1 - [[zzRules/DnD 5.5e Rules/04) Backlink Glossary/Equipment/Weapons/Martial Melee/Warhammer\|Warhammer]], Back 2 - Empty and, Backpack Sling* - Empty.  
A ***prowling Rogue assassin*** may have more secretive sheaths: Underarm - 2 [[zzRules/DnD 5.5e Rules/04) Backlink Glossary/Equipment/Weapons/Simple Melee/Dagger\|Dagger]]s, Inside Pocket - 3 [[zzRules/DnD 5.5e Rules/04) Backlink Glossary/Equipment/Weapons/Simple Ranged/Dart\|Dart]]s, Lower Back -  Empty, Left Belt - Empty, Right Boot - Empty.  

Whilst the Weapon Slots for each of these characters are mechanically identical, labelling them in this manner gets the players to imagine how and where *their* character may wear their weapons.

### Backpack Compartment Slots - Constitution 
#### ***A weighty backpack requires a sturdy frame to bear its load.***

##### Backpack Compartments
To an adventurer, their backpack is as important to them as their lifeblood. The more items they can hold in their backpack, the more prepared they will be, and the more items they can bring back to town for a tidy profit.  

But, not all backpacks are made equal, and some are able to hold quite an abundance of items. Such a backpack would be unwieldy and tiring to carry for long periods, hence they would need to be carried by someone with a good constitution.  

Any character can carry a backpack with a minimum of 6 Backpack Compartments, plus an additional compartment per Constitution modifier, up to nine Backpack Compartments in total.

Each Backpack Compartment can hold a number of items, depending on the size of the items and the size of the character, as described below.

##### Compartment Spaces
The size of a Backpack Compartment is dependant on the creature size. For a Small or Medium creature a Backpack Compartment contains 6 Compartment Spaces. For every creature size larger a Backpack Compartment doubles in Compartment Spaces, compared to the previous creature size. For each creature size smaller a Backpack Compartment size halves its Compartment Spaces.  
**Tiny - 3 Compartment Spaces**  
**Small or Medium - 6 Compartment Spaces**  
**Large - 12 Compartment Spaces**  
**Huge - 24 Compartment Spaces**  
**Gargantuan - 48 Compartment Spaces**


##### Item sizes
Items of different sizes or weights require different amounts of space to fit within a Backpack Compartment.  
The size of an item should be decided by the table, with the DM having the final say. When determining the size of an item consideration should be given to the size and also the weight of the item.

These items can be described by the following categories:  
**Trinket - negligible space used** (tiny single items, lockets, gems, featherweight items etc)  
**Small - 1 Compartment Space** (A couple of candles, quite light items etc)  
**Medium - 3 Compartment Spaces** (A shoebox, fairly weighty items etc)  
**Large - 6 Compartment Spaces** (A small painting, somewhat heavy items etc)  
**Oversized - Cannot fit in backpack, or very heavy**. If an item requires more spaces than a Backpack Compartment holds, this item cannot be placed into the backpack. Such items must be carried by hand, if they could even be liftable at all. (e.g an anvil, or a small anvil etc)  
The given Item Sizes should be considered a guide, a Huge creature for example may be able to carry items in their Backpack Compartments which may be unreasonable for creatures of other sizes to even pick up.

So long as enough space remains within a Backpack Compartment, any number of items can be placed within.


##### Adding Flavour
Some players may not enjoy the image of their character always carrying around a full backpack, especially a full sized hiking backpack.  
In cases like these consider that a long coat may contain a selection of pockets, combined with a smaller messenger bag.  
On the other hand a halfling's player may enjoy the image of carrying a wheelbarrow around with them.

>[!tip] Backpack Compartments Rule at a Glance
A character has a total of 6+(Con. mod) Backpack Compartments.  
Each Backpack Compartment contains 6 Compartment Spaces (for a Small or Medium creature).  
The number of Compartment Spaces required to store an item is dependant on the Item Size.


### Accessing the Backpack

#### ***Failed to prepare? Not prepared to fail? Don't worry, there is still hope.***

Is the BBEG resistant to bludgeoning and you only equipped your warhammer? Unfortunately it's going to take some time to fix it, but worry not because you have now created a decision for yourself and we all know that making decisions is the true fun in Tabletop RPGs.

Of course you can spend your time flailing your hammer about and having your abilities make up the short fall, or you could take your backpack off and start rummaging.

Accessing your backpack does take quite a long time, and a lot of focus however. As such in order to do so you must make the Use Action, as well as spending either your Bonus Action or your entire Move Speed. Doing so will allow you to either place one item into ***or*** take one item out of your backpack.  

If you wish to both place one item into the backpack as well as take one item out, you may do so as long as it is the only thing you do on your turn.

You may access another character's backpack to remove one item, or place one item in, as an Action. 
If you wish to both place one item into the backpack as well as take one item out, you may do so by spending an Action and a Bonus Action.


>[!tip] Accessing the Backpack Rule at a Glance
You may take one item out, or place one item in to your backpack using an Action, as well as either a Bonus Action or spending your full movement.  
You may take one item out and place one item in to your backpack as long as you do nothing else on your turn.  
You may take one item out, or place one item in to another character's backpack as an Action.  
You may take one item out and place one item in to another character's backpack by using an Action and a Bonus Action.


## Optional Rules

### Ammunition Bearing Slots - Dexterity

Each type of ammunition ***must*** be stored in some kind of ammunition holder. Consider an arrow quiver, bolt case, or bullet pouch for example. In this system these are referred to as Ammunition Bearing Slots.

Any character is able to use an Ammunition Bearing Slot to store fifteen ammunition, plus an additional five ammunition per Dexterity modifier, up to a maximum of thirty in total.

An Ammunition Bearing Slot must replace either a Weapon Slot or Backpack Compartment, decided by the player.

An Ammunition Bearing Slot may only hold one type of ammunition at a time, though the quality and effects of that ammunition may be mixed. For example, magical and non-magical arrows may be placed into the same quiver, but arrows and bolts may not.


> [!tip] Ammunition Bearing Slots Rule at a Glance
Ammunition must be stored in an Ammunition Bearing Slot.  
An Ammunition Bearing Slot may replace either a Weapon Slot or Backpack Compartment Slot, decided by the player.
Each Ammunition Bearing Slot may hold 15+5/Dex. mod, up to a maximum of 30 ammunition of a single type.


### Bottle Slots - Intelligence/Wisdom

As with weapons, any potions or other vials can be stored within a backpack, but access during combat should be difficult. Therefore, a prepared character will store required items within reach in areas called Bottle Slots.

Every character has a maximum of five Bottle Slots in which they may store their bottles, these are in addition to any Weapon Slots or Backpack Compartment Slots. Using these potions still requires an Action/Bonus Action as stated in the item's rules.

All characters have access to two Bottle Slots, plus an additional Bottle Slot per Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (whichever is the highest), up to a maximum of five. A Bottle Slot may only hold one bottle, regardless of its type - Potion, Vial etc.


> [!tip] Bottle Slots Rule at a Glance
A character has 2+(Highest of Int. or Wis. mod) Bottle Slots.  
A Bottle Slot holds a single Potion, Vial, etc.  
A Bottle Slot is easily accessible during combat, but still requires an Action/Bonus Action to Use.


### Advice Slots - Charisma

Characters with a high Charisma love to share stories. By doing so they have often heard some kind of method another adventurer swears by to improve their preparedness. These methods can be passed on to other characters for their own benefit.

As such, any character may provide a character, other than themselves, with an Advice Slot. An Advice Slot is exchanged by the receiving character for an extra Slot of any other kind. The Advice Slot cannot put a character above the maximum allowance of that Slot kind.

Any character has a number of Advice Slots equal to their Charisma Modifier, up to a maximum of three.

Often people will revert to their habitual ways, because of this you may take back an Advice Slot at any time after at least five days have passed. The benefits that this Advice Slot provided to the character are immediately lost.


>[!tip] Advice Slots Rule at a Glance
A character has a number of Advice Slots equal to their Charisma Modifier, up to a maximum of 3.  
An Advice Slot may be given to a character other than themselves, which is then exchanged for a different Slot of any kind.  
An Advice Slot may be returned or taken back after 5 days has passed.

## Alternative Rules

### Scroll Slots - Alternative Intelligence

Consider instead that Bottle Slots are Wisdom based only.

This would open up a character to instead be skilled in storing Spell Scrolls. This is a situation which is less likely to be relevant, however, sometimes putting a 'limitation' on something can remind a player that such a mechanic exists. 

If you wish to use this mechanic the rule would follow similarly to other rules:
*Any character has Spell Scroll Slots equal to 2+(Int. mod), up to a maximum of 5.*

### The Physical Backpack

Under the core rules, the backpack which contains the Backpack Compartments is essentially considered incorporeal.
:
By this it is meant that a character will always have ***their*** backpack, and this backpack has a specific number of Backpack Compartments and Compartment Size, this should be considered a hard stop, the backpack cannot be overfilled. 
:
An alternative to this rule could be that any character has access to backpacks of all sizes, be they purchasable from a store, gifts from another creature, or crafted.
:
Alternatively perhaps individual Backpack Compartments can be added to a backpack, or coat etc.
:
For such a scenario, you should note the maximum number of filled Backpack Compartment Spaces the character can carry. If the character increases their filled Backpack Compartment Spaces above this amount then they should be considered ***Encumbered***, and any effects should be applied as per the rule book.
