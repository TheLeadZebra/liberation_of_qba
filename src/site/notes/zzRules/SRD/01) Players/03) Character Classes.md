29 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
While active, your Rage follows the rules below.  
Damage Resistance. You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.  
Rage Damage. When you make an attack using  
Strength—with either a weapon or an Unarmed  
Strike—and deal damage to the target, you gain  
a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain  
levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage  
column of the Barbarian Features table.  
Strength Advantage. You have Advantage on  
Strength checks and Strength saving throws.  
No Concentration or Spells. You can’t maintain  
Concentration, and you can’t cast spells.  
Duration. The Rage lasts until the end of your  
next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor  
or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage  
is still active on your next turn, you can extend  
the Rage for another round by doing one of the  
following:  
• Make an attack roll against an enemy.  
• Force an enemy to make a saving throw.  
• Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.  
Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end  
of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to  
10 minutes.  
Level 1: Unarmored Defense  
While you aren’t wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain  
this benefit.  
Level 1: Weapon Mastery  
Your training with weapons allows you to use the  
mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long  
Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one  
of those weapon choices.  
When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain  
the ability to use the mastery properties of more  
kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery  
column of the Barbarian Features table.  
Level 2: Danger Sense  
You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren’t as  
they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge  
perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity saving  
throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition.  
Level 2: Reckless Attack  
You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your  
first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next  
turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage  
during that time.  
Level 3: Barbarian Subclass  
You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The  
Path of the Berserker subclass is detailed after this  
class’s description. A subclass is a specialization  
that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels.  
For the rest of your career, you gain each of your  
subclass’s features that are of your Barbarian level  
or lower.  
Level 3: Primal Knowledge  
You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice  
from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1.  
In addition, while your Rage is active, you can  
channel primal power when you attempt certain  
tasks; whenever you make an ability check using  
one of the following skills, you can make it as a  
Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception,  
Stealth, or Survival. When you use this ability, your  
Strength represents primal power coursing through  
you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.  
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement  
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see  
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you  
qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.  
Level 5: Extra Attack  
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you  
take the Attack action on your turn.  
Level 5: Fast Movement  
Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t  
wearing Heavy armor.  
Level 7: Feral Instinct  
Your instincts are so honed that you have Advantage on Initiative rolls.  
Level 7: Instinctive Pounce  
As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your  
Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.  
Level 9: Brutal Strike  
If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Advantage on one Strength-based attack roll of your  
choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn’t  
have Disadvantage. If the chosen attack roll hits, the  
target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type  
dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can  
cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You  
have the following effect options.  
Forceful Blow. The target is pushed 15 feet  
straight away from you. You can then move up to  
half your Speed straight toward the target without  
provoking Opportunity Attacks.  
30 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Hamstring Blow. The target’s Speed is reduced by  
15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can  
be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time—  
the most recent one.  
Level 11: Relentless Rage  
Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous  
wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage  
is active and don’t die outright, you can make a DC  
10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your  
Hit Points instead change to a number equal to  
twice your Barbarian level.  
Each time you use this feature after the first, the  
DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long  
Rest, the DC resets to 10.  
Level 13: Improved Brutal Strike  
You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The  
following effects are now among your Brutal Strike  
options.  
Staggering Blow. The target has Disadvantage on  
the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t make  
Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next  
turn.  
Sundering Blow. Before the start of your next  
turn, the next attack roll made by another creature  
against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An  
attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.  
Level 15: Persistent Rage  
When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage  
in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a  
Long Rest.  
In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts  
for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything  
to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends  
early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just  
the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armor.  
Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike  
The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to  
2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal  
Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike  
feature.  
Level 18: Indomitable Might  
If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving  
throw is less than your Strength score, you can use  
that score in place of the total.  
Level 19: Epic Boon  
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another  
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of  
Irresistible Offense is recommended.  
Level 20: Primal Champion  
You embody primal power. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.  
Barbarian Subclass:  
Path of the Berserker  
Channel Rage into Violent Fury  
Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker  
direct their Rage primarily toward violence. Their  
path is one of untrammeled fury, and they thrill in  
the chaos of battle as they allow their Rage to seize  
and empower them.  
Level 3: Frenzy  
If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active,  
you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on  
your turn with a Strength-based attack. To determine the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal  
to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together.  
The damage has the same type as the weapon or  
Unarmed Strike used for the attack.  
Level 6: Mindless Rage  
You have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions while your Rage is active. If you’re  
Charmed or Frightened when you enter your Rage,  
the condition ends on you.  
Level 10: Retaliation  
When you take damage from a creature that is  
within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to  
make one melee attack against that creature, using  
a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.  
Level 14: Intimidating Presence  
As a Bonus Action, you can strike terror into others  
with your menacing presence and primal power.  
When you do so, each creature of your choice in a  
30-foot Emanation originating from you must make  
a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength  
modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save,  
a creature has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the Frightened creature’s  
turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again  
until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a use  
of your Rage (no action required) to restore your  
use of it.

one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can  
have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.  
Once within the next hour when the creature fails  
a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic  
Inspiration die is expended when it’s rolled.  
Number of Uses. You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma  
modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
At Higher Levels. Your Bardic Inspiration die  
changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as  
shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at  
level 10, and a d12 at level 15.  
Level 1: Spellcasting  
You have learned to cast spells through your bardic  
arts. See “Spells” for the rules on spellcasting. The  
information below details how you use those rules  
with Bard spells, which appear in the Bard spell list  
later in the class’s description.  
Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice  
from the Bard spell list. Dancing Lights and Vicious  
Mockery are recommended.  
Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace  
one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your  
choice from the Bard spell list.  
When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn  
another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell  
list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard  
Features table.  
Spell Slots. The Bard Features table shows how  
many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+  
spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.  
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the  
list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to  
cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1  
spells from the Bard spell list. Charm Person, Color  
Spray, Dissonant Whispers, and Healing Word are  
recommended.  
The number of spells on your list increases as you  
gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells  
column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that  
number increases, choose additional spells from the  
Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list  
matches the number on the table. The chosen spells  
must be of a level for which you have spell slots.  
For example, if you’re a level 3 Bard, your list of  
prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and  
2 in any combination.  
If another Bard feature gives you spells that you  
always have prepared, those spells don’t count  
against the number of spells you can prepare with  
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as  
Bard spells for you.  
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you  
gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your  
list with another Bard spell for which you have spell  
slots.  
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.  
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.  
Level 2: Expertise  
You gain Expertise (see “Rules Glossary”) in two of  
your skill proficiencies of your choice. Performance  
and Persuasion are recommended if you have proficiency in them.  
At Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of  
your skill proficiencies of your choice.  
Level 2: Jack of All Trades  
You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round  
down) to any ability check you make that uses a  
skill proficiency you lack and that doesn’t otherwise  
use your Proficiency Bonus.  
For example, if you make a Strength (Athletics)  
check and lack Athletics proficiency, you can add  
half your Proficiency Bonus to the check.  
Level 3: Bard Subclass  
You gain a Bard subclass of your choice. The College  
of Lore subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you  
features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your  
career, you gain each of your subclass’s features  
that are of your Bard level or lower.  
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement  
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see  
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you  
qualify. You gain this feature again at Bard levels 8,  
12, and 16.  
Level 5: Font of Inspiration  
You now regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest.  
In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action  
required) to regain one expended use of Bardic  
Inspiration.  
33 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Level 7: Countercharm  
You can use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature  
within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an  
effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened condition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to  
be rerolled, and the new roll has Advantage.  
Level 10: Magical Secrets  
You’ve learned secrets from various magical traditions. Whenever you reach a Bard level (including  
this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the  
Bard Features table increases, you can choose any  
of your new prepared spells from the Bard, Cleric,  
Druid, and Wizard spell lists, and the chosen spells  
count as Bard spells for you (see a class’s section for  
its spell list). In addition, whenever you replace a  
spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with  
a spell from those lists.  
Level 18: Superior Inspiration  
When you roll Initiative, you regain expended uses  
of Bardic Inspiration until you have two if you have  
fewer than that.  
Level 19: Epic Boon  
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another  
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of  
Spell Recall is recommended.  
Level 20: Words of Creation  
You have mastered two of the Words of Creation:  
the words of life and death. You therefore always  
have the Power Word Heal and Power Word Kill  
spells prepared. When you cast either spell, you can  
target a second creature with it if that creature is  
within 10 feet of the first target.  
Bard Spell List  
This section presents the Bard spell list. The spells  
are organized by spell level and then alphabetized,  
and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, C means the spell requires Concentration, R means it’s a Ritual, and M means it requires a  
specific Material component.

College of Lore  
Plumb the Depths of Magical Knowledge  
Bards of the College of Lore collect spells and secrets from diverse sources, such as scholarly tomes,  
mystical rites, and peasant tales. The college’s members gather in libraries and universities to share  
their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important  
figures of authority.  
Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies  
You gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.  
Level 3: Cutting Words  
You learn to use your wit to supernaturally distract,  
confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see  
within 60 feet of yourself makes a damage roll or  
succeeds on an ability check or attack roll, you can  
take a Reaction to expend one use of your Bardic  
Inspiration; roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and  
subtract the number rolled from the creature’s roll,  
reducing the damage or potentially turning the success into a failure.  
Level 6: Magical Discoveries  
You learn two spells of your choice. These spells can  
come from the Cleric, Druid, or Wizard spell list or  
any combination thereof (see a class’s section for its  
spell list). A spell you choose must be a cantrip or a  
spell for which you have spell slots, as shown in the  
Bard Features table.  
You always have the chosen spells prepared, and  
whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one  
of the spells with another spell that meets these  
requirements.  
Level 14: Peerless Skill  
When you make an ability check or attack roll and  
fail, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration;  
roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number  
rolled to the d20, potentially turning a failure into  
a success. On a failure, the Bardic Inspiration isn’t  
expended.

37 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn  
another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell  
list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric  
Features table.  
Spell Slots. The Cleric Features table shows how  
many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+  
spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.  
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list  
of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast  
with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells  
from the Cleric spell list. Bless, Cure Wounds, Guiding  
Bolt, and Shield of Faith are recommended.  
The number of spells on your list increases as you  
gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells  
column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that  
number increases, choose additional spells from the  
Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your  
list matches the number on the table. The chosen  
spells must be of a level for which you have spell  
slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list  
of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1  
and 2 in any combination.  
If another Cleric feature gives you spells that  
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count  
against the number of spells you can prepare with  
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as  
Cleric spells for you.  
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you  
finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with  
other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.  
Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting  
ability for your Cleric spells.  
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as  
a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.  
Level 1: Divine Order  
You have dedicated yourself to one of the following  
sacred roles of your choice.  
Protector. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency  
with Martial weapons and training with Heavy  
armor.  
Thaumaturge. You know one extra cantrip from  
the Cleric spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your  
Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) checks. The bonus  
equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).  
Level 2: Channel Divinity  
You can channel divine energy directly from the  
Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with  
two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead,  
each of which is described below. Each time you use  
this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel  
Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.  
You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice.  
You regain one of its expended uses when you finish  
a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when  
you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses  
when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in  
the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features  
table.  
If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving  
throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this  
class’s Spellcasting feature.  
Divine Spark. As a Magic action, you point your  
Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within  
30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it.  
Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either  
restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total  
or force the creature to make a Constitution saving  
throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic  
or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as  
much damage (round down).  
You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric  
levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).  
Turn Undead. As a Magic action, you present your  
Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each  
Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must  
make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails  
its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated  
conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries  
to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This  
effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if  
you die.  
Level 3: Cleric Subclass  
You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The Life  
Domain subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants  
you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of  
your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Cleric level or lower.  
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement  
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see  
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you  
qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8,  
12, and 16.  
Level 5: Sear Undead  
Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a  
number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier  
(minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each  
Undead that fails its saving throw against that use  
of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the  
roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn effect.  
38 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Level 7: Blessed Strikes  
Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of  
the following options of your choice (if you get either option from a Cleric subclass in an older book,  
use only the option you choose for this feature).  
Divine Strike. Once on each of your turns when  
you hit a creature with an attack roll using a  
weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra  
1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice).  
Potent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier  
to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.  
Level 10: Divine Intervention  
You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a Magic action, choose any  
Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a  
Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast  
that spell without expending a spell slot or needing  
Material components. You can’t use this feature  
again until you finish a Long Rest.  
Level 14: Improved Blessed Strikes  
The option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows  
more powerful.  
Divine Strike. The extra damage of your Divine  
Strike increases to 2d8.  
Potent Spellcasting. When you cast a Cleric cantrip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can  
give vitality to yourself or another creature within  
60 feet of yourself, granting a number of Temporary  
Hit Points equal to twice your Wisdom modifier.  
Level 19: Epic Boon  
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another  
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of  
Fate is recommended.  
Level 20: Greater Divine Intervention  
You can call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention feature, you can choose Wish when you select a spell.  
If you do so, you can’t use Divine Intervention again  
until you finish 2d4 Long Rests.  
Cleric Spell List  
This section presents the Cleric spell list. The spells  
are organized by spell level and then alphabetized,  
and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, C means the spell requires Concentration, R means it’s a Ritual, and M means it requires a  
specific Material component.

Cleric Subclass: Life Domain  
Soothe the Hurts of the World  
The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that  
helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who  
tap into this domain are masters of healing, using  
that life force to cure many hurts.  
Existence itself relies on the positive energy associated with this domain, so a Cleric of almost any  
religious tradition might choose it. This domain is  
particularly associated with agricultural deities,  
gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and  
community. Religious orders of healing also seek  
the magic of this domain.  
Level 3: Disciple of Life  
When a spell you cast with a spell slot restores Hit  
Points to a creature, that creature regains additional Hit Points on the turn you cast the spell. The  
additional Hit Points equal 2 plus the spell slot’s  
level.  
Level 3: Life Domain Spells  
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you  
always have certain spells ready. When you reach  
a Cleric level specified in the Life Domain Spells  
table, you thereafter always have the listed spells  
prepared.

Prepared Spells  
3 Aid, Bless, Cure Wounds,  
Lesser Restoration  
5 Mass Healing Word, Revivify  
7 Aura of Life, Death Ward  
9 Greater Restoration, Mass Cure Wounds  
Level 3: Preserve Life  
As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol  
and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke  
healing energy that can restore a number of Hit  
Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose  
Bloodied creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which  
can include you), and divide those Hit Points among  
them. This feature can restore a creature to no  
more than half its Hit Point maximum.  
Level 6: Blessed Healer  
The healing spells you cast on others heal you as  
well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell  
slot that restores Hit Points to one or more creatures other than yourself, you regain Hit Points  
equal to 2 plus the spell slot’s level.  
Level 17: Supreme Healing  
When you would normally roll one or more dice to  
restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Channel Divinity, don’t roll those dice for the healing; instead use the highest number possible for each die.  
For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a  
creature with a spell, you restore 12.

42 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
how you use those rules with Druid spells, which  
appear on the Druid spell list later in the class’s  
description.  
Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice  
from the Druid spell list. Druidcraft and Produce  
Flame are recommended.  
Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace  
one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your  
choice from the Druid spell list.  
When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn  
another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell  
list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid  
Features table.  
Spell Slots. The Druid Features table shows how  
many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+  
spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.  
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the  
list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to  
cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1  
spells from the Druid spell list. Animal Friendship,  
Cure Wounds, Faerie Fire, and Thunderwave are  
recommended.  
The number of spells on your list increases as you  
gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells  
column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that  
number increases, choose additional spells from the  
Druid spell list until the number of spells on your  
list matches the number on the table. The chosen  
spells must be of a level for which you have spell  
slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid, your list  
of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1  
and 2 in any combination.  
If another Druid feature gives you spells that  
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count  
against the number of spells you can prepare with  
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as  
Druid spells for you.  
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you  
finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other  
Druid spells for which you have spell slots.  
Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting  
ability for your Druid spells.  
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus  
as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.  
Level 1: Druidic  
You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids.  
While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals;  
you always have the Speak with Animals spell  
prepared.  
You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You  
and others who know Druidic automatically spot  
such a message. Others spot the message’s presence  
with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)  
check but can’t decipher it without magic.  
Level 1: Primal Order  
You have dedicated yourself to one of the following  
sacred roles of your choice.  
Magician. You know one extra cantrip from the  
Druid spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence  
(Arcana or Nature) checks. The bonus equals your  
Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1).  
Warden. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency  
with Martial weapons and training with Medium  
armor.  
Level 2: Wild Shape  
The power of nature allows you to assume the form  
of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into  
a Beast form that you have learned for this feature  
(see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form  
for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level  
or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form  
early as a Bonus Action.  
Number of Uses. You can use Wild Shape twice.  
You regain one expended use when you finish a  
Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when  
you finish a Long Rest.  
You gain additional uses when you reach certain  
Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of  
the Druid Features table.  
Known Forms. You know four Beast forms for this  
feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that  
have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that  
lack a Fly Speed (see “Animals” in “Monsters” for  
stat block options). The Rat, Riding Horse, Spider,  
and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a  
Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms  
with another eligible form.  
When you reach certain Druid levels, your number  
of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating  
for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast  
Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can  
adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.  
When choosing known forms, you may look in  
other sources for eligible Beasts if the Game Master  
permits you to do so.

43 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Rules While Shape-Shifted. While in a form, you  
retain your personality, memories, and ability to  
speak, and the following rules apply:  
Temporary Hit Points. When you assume a Wild  
Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit  
Points equal to your Druid level.  
Game Statistics. Your game statistics are replaced  
by the Beast’s stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence,  
Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features;  
languages; and feats. You also retain your skill  
and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the  
proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving  
throw modifier in the Beast’s stat block is higher  
than yours, use the one in the stat block.  
No Spellcasting. You can’t cast spells, but shapeshifting doesn’t break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast.  
Objects. Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form’s limbs rather than your own.  
In addition, you choose whether your equipment  
falls in your space, merges into your new form, or  
is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it’s practical for  
the new form to wear a piece of equipment based  
on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment  
doesn’t change size or shape to match the new  
form, and any equipment that the new form can’t  
wear must either fall to the ground or merge with  
the form. Equipment that merges with the form  
has no effect while you’re in that form.  
Level 2: Wild Companion  
You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an  
animal form to aid you. As a Magic action, you can  
expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the  
Find Familiar spell without Material components.  
When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is  
Fey and disappears when you finish a Long Rest.  
Level 3: Druid Subclass  
You gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The Circle  
of the Land subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants  
you features at certain Druid levels. For the rest of  
your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Druid level or lower.  
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement  
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see  
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you  
qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels 8,  
12, and 16.  
Level 5: Wild Resurgence  
Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of  
Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required).  
In addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape  
(no action required) to give yourself a level 1 spell  
slot, but you can’t do so again until you finish a Long  
Rest.  
Level 7: Elemental Fury  
The might of the elements flows through you. You  
gain one of the following options of your choice.  
Potent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier  
to the damage you deal with any Druid cantrip.  
Primal Strike. Once on each of your turns when  
you hit a creature with an attack roll using a  
weapon or a Beast form’s attack in Wild Shape, you  
can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Cold, Fire,  
Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you  
hit).  
Level 15: Improved Elemental Fury  
The option you chose for Elemental Fury grows  
more powerful, as detailed below.  
Potent Spellcasting. When you cast a Druid cantrip with a range of 10 feet or greater, the spell’s  
range increases by 300 feet.  
Primal Strike. The extra damage of your Primal  
Strike increases to 2d8.  
Level 18: Beast Spells  
While using Wild Shape, you can cast spells in Beast  
form, except for any spell that has a Material component with a cost specified or that consumes its  
Material component.  
Level 19: Epic Boon  
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another  
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended.  
Level 20: Archdruid  
The vitality of nature constantly blooms within you,  
granting you the following benefits.  
Evergreen Wild Shape. Whenever you roll Initiative and have no uses of Wild Shape left, you regain  
one expended use of it.  
Nature Magician. You can convert uses of Wild  
Shape into a spell slot (no action required). Choose  
a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape  
and convert them into a single spell slot, with each  
use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if you  
convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level  
4 spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do  
so again until you finish a Long Rest.  
Longevity. The primal magic that you wield  
causes you to age more slowly. For every ten years  
that pass, your body ages only one year.

Druid Subclass:  
Circle of the Land  
Celebrate Connection to the Natural World  
The Circle of the Land comprises mystics and sages  
who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites. These  
Druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The  
circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests  
of their communities.  
Level 3: Circle of the Land Spells  
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, choose one type  
of land: arid, polar, temperate, or tropical. Consult  
the table below that corresponds to the chosen  
type; you have the spells listed for your Druid level  
and lower prepared.

5 Stinking Cloud  
7 Polymorph  
9 Insect Plague  
Level 3: Land’s Aid  
As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild  
Shape and choose a point within 60 feet of yourself.  
Vitality-giving flowers and life-draining thorns  
appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point. Each creature of your choice in  
the Sphere must make a Constitution saving throw  
against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 Necrotic  
damage on a failed save or half as much damage on  
a successful one. One creature of your choice in that  
area regains 2d6 Hit Points.  
The damage and healing increase by 1d6 when  
you reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6).  
Level 6: Natural Recovery  
You can cast one of the level 1+ spells that you have  
prepared from your Circle Spells feature without  
expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long  
Rest before you do so again.  
In addition, when you finish a Short Rest, you can  
choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell  
slots can have a combined level that is equal to or  
less than half your Druid level (round up), and none  
of them can be level 6+. For example, if you’re a level  
6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels’ worth of  
spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level  
2 and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell slots.  
Once you recover spell slots with this feature, you  
can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.  
Level 10: Nature’s Ward  
You are immune to the Poisoned condition, and you  
have Resistance to a damage type associated with  
your current land choice in the Circle Spells feature,  
as shown in the Nature’s Ward table.  
Nature’s Ward  

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Land Type|Resistance|Land Type|Resistance|
|Arid|Fire|Temperate|Lightning|
|Polar|Cold|Tropical|Poison|

Level 14: Nature’s Sanctuary  
As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild  
Shape and cause spectral trees and vines to appear  
in a 15-foot Cube on the ground within 120 feet of  
yourself. They last there for 1 minute or until you  
have the Incapacitated condition or die. You and  
your allies have Half Cover while in that area, and  
your allies gain the current Resistance of your Nature’s Ward while there.  
As a Bonus Action, you can move the Cube up to  
60 feet to ground within 120 feet of yourself.

Level 1: Second Wind  
You have a limited well of physical and mental  
stamina that you can draw on. As a Bonus Action,  
you can use it to regain Hit Points equal to 1d10  
plus your Fighter level.  
You can use this feature twice. You regain one  
expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you  
regain all expended uses when you finish a Long  
Rest.  
When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain  
more uses of this feature, as shown in the Second  
Wind column of the Fighter Features table.  
Level 1: Weapon Mastery  
Your training with weapons allows you to use the  
mastery properties of three kinds of Simple or Martial weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish  
a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and  
change one of those weapon choices.  
When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain  
the ability to use the mastery properties of more  
kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery  
column of the Fighter Features table.  
Level 2: Action Surge  
You can push yourself beyond your normal limits  
for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action, except the Magic action.  
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again  
until you finish a Short or Long Rest. Starting at  
level 17, you can use it twice before a rest but only  
once on a turn.  
Level 2: Tactical Mind  
You have a mind for tactics on and off the battlefield. When you fail an ability check, you can expend  
a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward  
success. Rather than regaining Hit Points, you roll  
1d10 and add the number rolled to the ability check,  
potentially turning it into a success. If the check still  
fails, this use of Second Wind isn’t expended.  
Level 3: Fighter Subclass  
You gain a Fighter subclass of your choice. The  
Champion subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants  
you features at certain Fighter levels. For the rest  
of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Fighter level or lower.  
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement  
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see  
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you  
qualify. You gain this feature again at Fighter levels  
6, 8, 12, 14, and 16.  
Level 5: Extra Attack  
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you  
take the Attack action on your turn.  
Level 5: Tactical Shift  
Whenever you activate your Second Wind with a  
Bonus Action, you can move up to half your Speed  
without provoking Opportunity Attacks.  
Level 9: Indomitable  
If you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a  
bonus equal to your Fighter level. You must use the  
new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until  
you finish a Long Rest.  
You can use this feature twice before a Long Rest  
starting at level 13 and three times before a Long  
Rest starting at level 17.  
Level 9: Tactical Master  
When you attack with a weapon whose mastery  
property you can use, you can replace that property  
with the Push, Sap, or Slow property for that attack.  
Level 11: Two Extra Attacks  
You can attack three times instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.  
Level 13: Studied Attacks  
You study your opponents and learn from each attack you make. If you make an attack roll against a  
creature and miss, you have Advantage on your next  
attack roll against that creature before the end of  
your next turn.  
Level 19: Epic Boon  
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another  
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of  
Combat Prowess is recommended.  
Level 20: Three Extra Attacks  
You can attack four times instead of once whenever  
you take the Attack action on your turn.

Grapple or Shove option of your Unarmed Strike,  
you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your  
Strength modifier to determine the save DC.  
Level 1: Unarmored Defense  
While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a  
Shield, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your  
Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers.  
Level 2: Monk’s Focus  
Your focus and martial training allow you to harness a well of extraordinary energy within yourself.  
This energy is represented by Focus Points. Your  
Monk level determines the number of points you  
have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the  
Monk Features table.  
You can expend these points to enhance or fuel  
certain Monk features. You start knowing three  
such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and  
Step of the Wind, each of which is detailed below.  
When you expend a Focus Point, it is unavailable  
until you finish a Short or Long Rest, at the end of  
which you regain all your expended points.  
Some features that use Focus Points require your  
target to make a saving throw. The save DC equals 8  
plus your Wisdom modifier and Proficiency Bonus.  
Flurry of Blows. You can expend 1 Focus Point to  
make two Unarmed Strikes as a Bonus Action.  
Patient Defense. You can take the Disengage  
action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can

expend 1 Focus Point to take both the Disengage  
and the Dodge actions as a Bonus Action.  
Step of the Wind. You can take the Dash action  
as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can expend 1  
Focus Point to take both the Disengage and Dash  
actions as a Bonus Action, and your jump distance is  
doubled for the turn.  
Level 2: Unarmored Movement  
Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t  
wearing armor or wielding a Shield. This bonus  
increases when you reach certain Monk levels, as  
shown on the Monk Features table.  
Level 2: Uncanny Metabolism  
When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended Focus Points. When you do so, roll your  
Martial Arts die, and regain a number of Hit Points  
equal to your Monk level plus the number rolled.  
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again  
until you finish a Long Rest.  
Level 3: Deflect Attacks  
When an attack roll hits you and its damage includes Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage,  
you can take a Reaction to reduce the attack’s total  
damage against you. The reduction equals 1d10 plus  
your Dexterity modifier and Monk level.  
If you reduce the damage to 0, you can expend 1  
Focus Point to redirect some of the attack’s force.  
If you do so, choose a creature you can see within 5  
feet of yourself if the attack was a melee attack or a  
creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself that  
isn’t behind Total Cover if the attack was a ranged  
attack. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity  
saving throw or take damage equal to two rolls of  
your Martial Arts die plus your Dexterity modifier.  
The damage is the same type dealt by the attack.  
Level 3: Monk Subclass  
You gain a Monk subclass of your choice. The Warrior of the Open Hand subclass is detailed after this  
class’s description. A subclass is a specialization  
that grants you features at certain Monk levels. For  
the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Monk level or lower.  
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement  
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see  
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you  
qualify. You gain this feature again at Monk levels 8,  
12, and 16.  
Level 4: Slow Fall  
You can take a Reaction when you fall to reduce any  
damage you take from the fall by an amount equal  
to five times your Monk level.  
Level 5: Extra Attack  
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you  
take the Attack action on your turn.  
Level 5: Stunning Strike  
Once per turn when you hit a creature with a Monk  
weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can expend 1  
Focus Point to attempt a stunning strike. The target  
must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed  
save, the target has the Stunned condition until the  
start of your next turn. On a successful save, the  
target’s Speed is halved until the start of your next  
turn, and the next attack roll made against the target before then has Advantage.  
Level 6: Empowered Strikes  
Whenever you deal damage with your Unarmed  
Strike, it can deal your choice of Force damage or its  
normal damage type.  
Level 7: Evasion  
When you’re subjected to an effect that allows you  
to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half  
damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed  
on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail.  
You don’t benefit from this feature if you have the  
Incapacitated condition.  
Level 9: Acrobatic Movement  
While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a  
Shield, you gain the ability to move along vertical  
surfaces and across liquids on your turn without  
falling during the movement.  
Level 10: Heightened Focus  
Your Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of  
the Wind gain the following benefits.  
Flurry of Blows. You can expend 1 Focus Point  
to use Flurry of Blows and make three Unarmed  
Strikes with it instead of two.  
52 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Patient Defense. When you expend a Focus Point  
to use Patient Defense, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to two rolls of your Martial  
Arts die.  
Step of the Wind. When you expend a Focus Point  
to use Step of the Wind, you can choose a willing  
creature within 5 feet of yourself that is Large or  
smaller. You move the creature with you until the  
end of your turn. The creature’s movement doesn’t  
provoke Opportunity Attacks.  
Level 10: Self-Restoration  
Through sheer force of will, you can remove one  
of the following conditions from yourself at the  
end of each of your turns: Charmed, Frightened, or  
Poisoned.  
In addition, forgoing food and drink doesn’t give  
you levels of Exhaustion.  
Level 13: Deflect Energy  
You can now use your Deflect Attacks feature  
against attacks that deal any damage type, not just  
Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing.  
Level 14: Disciplined Survivor  
Your physical and mental discipline grant you proficiency in all saving throws.  
Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw  
and fail, you can expend 1 Focus Point to reroll it,  
and you must use the new roll.  
Level 15: Perfect Focus  
When you roll Initiative and don’t use Uncanny Metabolism, you regain expended Focus Points until  
you have 4 if you have 3 or fewer.  
Level 18: Superior Defense  
At the start of your turn, you can expend 3 Focus  
Points to bolster yourself against harm for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition.  
During that time, you have Resistance to all damage  
except Force damage.  
Level 19: Epic Boon  
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another  
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of  
Irresistible Offense is recommended.  
Level 20: Body and Mind  
You have developed your body and mind to new  
heights. Your Dexterity and Wisdom scores increase  
by 4, to a maximum of 25.  
Monk Subclass: Warrior of the  
Open Hand  
Master Unarmed Combat Techniques  
Warriors of the Open Hand are masters of unarmed  
combat. They learn techniques to push and trip  
their opponents and manipulate their own energy  
to protect themselves from harm.  
Level 3: Open Hand Technique  
Whenever you hit a creature with an attack granted  
by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the  
following effects on that target.  
Addle. The target can’t make Opportunity Attacks  
until the start of its next turn.  
Push. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from you.  
Topple. The target must succeed on a Dexterity  
saving throw or have the Prone condition.  
Level 6: Wholeness of Body  
You gain the ability to heal yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can roll your Martial Arts die. You regain  
a number of Hit Points equal to the number rolled  
plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point  
regained).  
You can use this feature a number of times equal  
to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and  
you regain all expended uses when you finish a  
Long Rest.  
Level 11: Fleet Step  
When you take a Bonus Action other than Step of  
the Wind, you can also use Step of the Wind immediately after that Bonus Action.  
Level 17: Quivering Palm  
You gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in  
someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an  
Unarmed Strike, you can expend 4 Focus Points  
to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last  
for a number of days equal to your Monk level. The  
vibrations are harmless unless you take an action  
to end them. Alternatively, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of the  
attacks to end the vibrations. To end them, you and  
the target must be on the same plane of existence.  
When you end them, the target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 Force damage on  
a failed save or half as much damage on a successful  
one.  
You can have only one creature under the effect  
of this feature at a time. You can end the vibrations  
harmlessly (no action required).

54 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
BrEakinG your oatH  
A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of  
conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible.  
Sometimes a Paladin transgresses their oath.  
A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks  
absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh.  
If your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath,  
talk to your GM. Your Paladin should probably take a  
more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class  
and adopt another one.  
As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature  
(which could be yourself) and draw power from the  
pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to  
that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.  
You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of  
healing power to remove the Poisoned condition  
from the creature; those points don’t also restore  
Hit Points to the creature.  
Level 1: Spellcasting  
You have learned to cast spells through prayer and  
meditation. See “Spells” for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use  
those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the  
Paladin spell list later in the class’s description.  
Spell Slots. The Paladin Features table shows  
how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+  
spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.  
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the  
list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to  
cast with this feature. To start, choose two level  
1 Paladin spells. Heroism and Searing Smite are  
recommended.  
The number of spells on your list increases as  
you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared  
Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional  
Paladin spells until the number of spells on your  
list matches the number in the Paladin Features  
table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which  
you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5  
Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six  
Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.  
If another Paladin feature gives you spells that  
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count  
against the number of spells you can prepare with  
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as  
Paladin spells for you.  
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you  
finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your  
list with another Paladin spell for which you have  
spell slots.  
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.  
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as  
a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.  
Level 1: Weapon Mastery  
Your training with weapons allows you to use the  
mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your  
choice with which you have proficiency, such as  
Longswords and Javelins.  
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change  
the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you  
could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails.  
Level 2: Fighting Style  
You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see  
“Feats” for feats). Instead of choosing one of those  
feats, you can choose the option below.  
Blessed Warrior. You learn two Cleric cantrips of  
your choice (see the Cleric class’s section for a list  
of Cleric spells). Guidance and Sacred Flame are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin  
spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting  
ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level,  
you can replace one of these cantrips with another  
Cleric cantrip.  
Level 2: Paladin’s Smite  
You always have the Divine Smite spell prepared. In  
addition, you can cast it without expending a spell  
slot, but you must finish a Long Rest before you can  
cast it in this way again.  
Level 3: Channel Divinity  
You can channel divine energy directly from the  
Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You  
start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is  
described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time  
you use this class’s Channel Divinity, you choose  
which effect from this class to create.  
You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice.  
You regain one of its expended uses when you finish  
a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when  
you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional use  
when you reach Paladin level 11.  
55 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving  
throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this  
class’s Spellcasting feature.  
Divine Sense. As a Bonus Action, you can open  
your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and  
Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have  
the Incapacitated condition, you know the location  
of any creature of those types within 60 feet of  
yourself, and you know its creature type. Within  
the same radius, you also detect the presence of any  
place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.  
Level 3: Paladin Subclass  
You gain a Paladin subclass of your choice. The Oath  
of Devotion subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants  
you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest  
of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Paladin level or lower.  
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement  
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see  
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you  
qualify. You gain this feature again at Paladin levels  
8, 12, and 16.  
Level 5: Extra Attack  
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you  
take the Attack action on your turn.  
Level 5: Faithful Steed  
You can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You  
always have the Find Steed spell prepared.  
You can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so  
when you finish a Long Rest.  
Level 6: Aura of Protection  
You radiate a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot  
Emanation that originates from you. The aura is inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition.  
You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to  
saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier  
(minimum bonus of +1).  
If another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the  
creature chooses which aura while in them.  
Level 9: Abjure Foes  
As a Magic action, you can expend one use of this  
class’s Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with  
awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon,  
you can target a number of creatures equal to your  
Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that  
you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target  
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the  
Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes  
any damage. While Frightened in this way, a target  
can do only one of the following on its turns: move,  
take an action, or take a Bonus Action.  
Level 10: Aura of Courage  
You and your allies have Immunity to the Frightened condition while in your Aura of Protection. If  
a Frightened ally enters the aura, that condition has  
no effect on that ally while there.  
Level 11: Radiant Strikes  
Your strikes now carry supernatural power. When  
you hit a target with an attack roll using a Melee  
weapon or an Unarmed Strike, the target takes an  
extra 1d8 Radiant damage.  
Level 14: Restoring Touch  
When you use Lay On Hands on a creature, you can  
also remove one or more of the following conditions  
from the creature: Blinded, Charmed, Deafened,  
Frightened, Paralyzed, or Stunned. You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool of Lay On  
Hands for each of these conditions you remove;  
those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the  
creature.  
Level 18: Aura Expansion  
Your Aura of Protection is now a 30-foot Emanation.  
Level 19: Epic Boon  
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another  
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of  
Truesight is recommended.

This section presents the Paladin spell list. The  
spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed.

Paladin Subclass: Oath of Devotion  
Uphold the Ideals of Justice and Order  
The Oath of Devotion binds Paladins to the ideals  
of justice and order. These Paladins meet the archetype of the knight in shining armor. They hold  
themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and  
some—for better or worse—hold the rest of the  
world to the same standards.  
Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods  
of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the  
measure of personal devotion. Others hold angels as  
their ideals and incorporate images of angelic wings  
into their helmets or coats of arms.  
These paladins share the following tenets:  
• Let your word be your promise.  
• Protect the weak and never fear to act.  
• Let your honorable deeds be an example.  
Level 3: Oath of Devotion Spells  
The magic of your oath ensures you always have  
certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level  
specified in the Oath of Devotion Spells table, you  
thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.  
Oath of Devotion Spells  
Paladin Level Spells  
3 Protection from Evil and Good,  
Shield of Faith  
5 Aid, Zone of Truth  
9 Beacon of Hope, Dispel Magic  
13 Freedom of Movement,  
Guardian of Faith  
17 Commune, Flame Strike  
Level 3: Sacred Weapon  
When you take the Attack action, you can expend  
one use of your Channel Divinity to imbue one  
Melee weapon that you are holding with positive  
energy. For 10 minutes or until you use this feature  
again, you add your Charisma modifier to attack  
rolls you make with that weapon (minimum bonus  
of +1), and each time you hit with it, you cause it to  
deal its normal damage type or Radiant damage.  
The weapon also emits Bright Light in a 20-foot  
radius and Dim Light 20 feet beyond that.  
You can end this effect early (no action required).  
This effect also ends if you aren’t carrying the  
weapon.  
Level 7: Aura of Devotion  
You and your allies have Immunity to the Charmed  
condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a  
Charmed ally enters the aura, that condition has no  
effect on that ally while there.  
57 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Level 15: Smite of Protection  
Your magical smite now radiates protective energy.  
Whenever you cast Divine Smite, you and your allies  
have Half Cover while in your Aura of Protection.

Becoming a Ranger …  
As a Level 1 Character

• Gain the Ranger’s level 1 features, which are  
listed in the Ranger Features table.  
As a Multiclass Character  
• Gain the following traits from the Core Ranger

choice from the Ranger’s skill list, and training  
with Light and Medium armor and Shields.

listed in the Ranger Features table. See the multiclassing rules in “Character Creation” to determine your available spell slots.  
Ranger Class Features  
As a Ranger, you gain the following class features  
when you reach the specified Ranger levels. These  
features are listed in the Ranger Features table.  
Level 1: Spellcasting  
You have learned to channel the magical essence of  
nature to cast spells. See “Spells” for the rules on  
spellcasting. The information below details how you  
use those rules with Ranger spells, which appear in  
the Ranger spell list later in the class’s description.  
Spell Slots. The Ranger Features table shows  
how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+  
spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.  
58 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the  
list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to  
cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1  
Ranger spells. Cure Wounds and Ensnaring Strike are  
recommended.  
The number of spells on your list increases as you  
gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells  
column of the Ranger Features table. Whenever that  
number increases, choose additional Ranger spells  
until the number of spells on your list matches the  
number in the Ranger Features table. The chosen  
spells must be of a level for which you have spell  
slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Ranger, your  
list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells  
of level 1 or 2 in any combination.  
If another Ranger feature gives you spells that  
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count  
against the number of spells you can prepare with  
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as  
Ranger spells for you.  
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you  
finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your  
list with another Ranger spell for which you have  
spell slots.  
Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting  
ability for your Ranger spells.  
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus  
as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.  
Level 1: Favored Enemy  
You always have the Hunter’s Mark spell prepared.  
You can cast it twice without expending a spell slot,  
and you regain all expended uses of this ability  
when you finish a Long Rest.  
The number of times you can cast the spell without a spell slot increases when you reach certain  
Ranger levels, as shown in the Favored Enemy column of the Ranger Features table.  
Level 1: Weapon Mastery  
Your training with weapons allows you to use the  
mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your  
Ranger Features

them. Whenever you gain a Ranger level, you can  
replace one of these cantrips with another Druid  
cantrip.  
Level 3: Ranger Subclass  
You gain a Ranger subclass of your choice. The

Long Rest.  
Decrease Exhaustion. Whenever you finish a  
Short Rest, your Exhaustion level, if any, decreases  
by 1.  
Level 13: Relentless Hunter  
Taking damage can’t break your Concentration on

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see  
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you  
qualify. You gain this feature again at Rogue levels  
8, 10, 12, and 16.  
Level 5: Cunning Strike  
You’ve developed cunning ways to use your Sneak  
Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you  
can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects.  
Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of  
Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the  
effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the  
effect occurs immediately after the attack’s damage  
is dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect,  
remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack’s damage before  
rolling.  
If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw,  
the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and  
Proficiency Bonus.  
Poison (Cost: 1d6). You add a toxin to your strike,  
forcing the target to make a Constitution saving  
throw. On a failed save, the target has the Poisoned  
condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its  
turns, the Poisoned target repeats the save, ending  
the effect on itself on a success.  
To use this effect, you must have a Poisoner’s Kit  
on your person.  
Trip (Cost: 1d6). If the target is Large or smaller,  
it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have  
the Prone condition.  
Withdraw (Cost: 1d6). Immediately after the  
attack, you move up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.  
Level 5: Uncanny Dodge  
When an attacker that you can see hits you with an  
attack roll, you can take a Reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you (round down).  
Level 7: Evasion  
You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain dangers. When you’re subjected to an effect that allows  
you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only  
half damage, you instead take no damage if you  
succeed on the saving throw and only half damage  
if you fail. You can’t use this feature if you have the  
Incapacitated condition.  
Level 7: Reliable Talent  
Whenever you make an ability check that uses one  
of your skill or tool proficiencies, you can treat a  
d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.  
Level 11: Improved Cunning Strike  
You can use up to two Cunning Strike effects when  
you deal Sneak Attack damage, paying the die cost  
for each effect.  
Level 14: Devious Strikes  
You’ve practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack  
deviously. The following effects are now among  
your Cunning Strike options.  
Daze (Cost: 2d6). The target must succeed on a  
Constitution saving throw, or on its next turn, it can  
do only one of the following: move or take an action  
or a Bonus Action.  
Knock Out (Cost: 6d6). The target must succeed  
on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the Unconscious condition for 1 minute or until it takes any  
damage. The Unconscious target repeats the save  
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on  
itself on a success.  
Obscure (Cost: 3d6). The target must succeed on  
a Dexterity saving throw, or it has the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn.  
Level 15: Slippery Mind  
Your cunning mind is exceptionally difficult to control. You gain proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma  
saving throws.  
Level 18: Elusive  
You’re so evasive that attackers rarely gain the  
upper hand against you. No attack roll can have  
Advantage against you unless you have the Incapacitated condition.  
Level 19: Epic Boon  
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another  
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of the  
Night Spirit is recommended.  
Level 20: Stroke of Luck  
You have a marvelous knack for succeeding when  
you need to. If you fail a D20 Test, you can turn the  
roll into a 20.  
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again  
until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

that condition on you if you end the turn behind  
Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover.  
Level 13: Use Magic Device  
You’ve learned how to maximize use of magic items,  
granting you the following benefits.  
Attunement. You can attune to up to four magic  
items at once.  
Charges. Whenever you use a magic item property that expends charges, roll 1d6. On a roll of  
6, you use the property without expending the  
charges.  
Scrolls. You can use any Spell Scroll, using Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for the spell. If the  
spell is a cantrip or a level 1 spell, you can cast it reliably. If the scroll contains a higher-level spell, you  
must first succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check  
(DC 10 plus the spell’s level). On a successful check,  
you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed check,  
the scroll disintegrates.  
Level 17: Thief’s Reflexes

• Gain the Hit Point Die from the Core Sorcerer  
Traits table.  
• Gain the Sorcerer’s level 1 features, which are  
listed in the Sorcerer Features table. See the multiclassing rules in “Character Creation” to determine your available spell slots.  
Sorcerer Class Features  
As a Sorcerer, you gain the following class features  
when you reach the specified Sorcerer levels. These  
features are listed in the Sorcerer Features table.  
Level 1: Spellcasting  
Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast  
spells. See “Spells” for the rules on spellcasting. The  
information below details how you use those rules  
with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the Sorcerer  
spell list later in the class’s description.  
Cantrips. You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your  
choice. Light, Prestidigitation, Shocking Grasp, and  
Sorcerous Burst are recommended. Whenever you  
gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your  
cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer  
cantrip of your choice.  
When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you  
learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as  
shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table.  
Spell Slots. The Sorcerer Features table shows  
how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+  
65 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.  
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list  
of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast  
with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. Burning Hands and Detect Magic are  
recommended.  
The number of spells on your list increases as  
you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared  
Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional  
Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your  
list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features  
table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which  
you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3  
Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six  
Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.  
If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that  
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count  
against the number of spells you can prepare with  
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as  
Sorcerer spells for you.  
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you  
gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on  
your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you  
have spell slots.  
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.  
Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus  
as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.  
Level 1: Innate Sorcery  
An event in your past left an indelible mark on you,  
infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus  
Action, you can unleash that magic for 1 minute,  
during which you gain the following benefits:

• The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells  
increases by 1.  
• You have Advantage on the attack rolls of  
Sorcerer spells you cast.  
You can use this feature twice, and you regain all  
expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.  
Level 2: Font of Magic  
You can tap into the wellspring of magic within  
yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery  
Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.  
You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as  
you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery  
Points column of the Sorcerer Features table. You  
can’t have more Sorcery Points than the number  
shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a Long Rest.  
You can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as  
Metamagic, that use those points.  
Converting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points. You  
can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery  
Points equal to the slot’s level (no action required).  
Creating Spell Slots. As a Bonus Action, you can  
transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell  
slot. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost  
of creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists  
the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create  
a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than  
level 5.  
Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest.

Level 2: Metamagic  
Because your magic flows from within, you can  
alter your spells to suit your needs; you gain two  
Metamagic options of your choice from “Metamagic  
Options” later in this class’s description. You use  
the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you  
cast. To use an option, you must spend the number  
of Sorcery Points that it costs.  
You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell  
when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of  
those options.  
Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you  
don’t know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer  
level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.  
Level 3: Sorcerer Subclass  
You gain a Sorcerer subclass of your choice. The  
Draconic Sorcery subclass is detailed after this  
class’s description. A subclass is a specialization  
that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels.  
For the rest of your career, you gain each of your  
subclass’s features that are of your Sorcerer level or  
lower.  
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement  
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see  
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you  
qualify. You gain this feature again at Sorcerer levels 8, 12, and 16.  
Level 5: Sorcerous Restoration  
When you finish a Short Rest, you can regain expended Sorcery Points, but no more than a number  
equal to half your Sorcerer level (round down). Once  
you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you  
finish a Long Rest.  
Level 7: Sorcery Incarnate  
If you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can  
use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take  
the Bonus Action to activate it.  
In addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is  
active, you can use up to two of your Metamagic options on each spell you cast.  
Level 19: Epic Boon  
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another  
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended.  
Level 20: Arcane Apotheosis  
While your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can  
use one Metamagic option on each of your turns  
without spending Sorcery Points on it.  
Metamagic Options  
The following options are available to your Metamagic feature. The options are presented in alphabetical order.  
Careful Spell  
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point  
When you cast a spell that forces other creatures  
to make a saving throw, you can protect some of  
those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so,  
spend 1 Sorcery Point and choose a number of those  
creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum  
of one creature). A chosen creature automatically  
succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and  
67 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
it takes no damage if it would normally take half  
damage on a successful save.  
Distant Spell  
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point  
When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 5  
feet, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double the  
spell’s range. Or when you cast a spell that has a  
range of Touch, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to  
make the spell’s range 30 feet.  
Empowered Spell  
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point  
When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1  
Sorcery Point to reroll a number of the damage dice  
up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one),  
and you must use the new rolls.  
You can use Empowered Spell even if you’ve already used a different Metamagic option during the  
casting of the spell.  
Extended Spell  
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point  
When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours.  
If the affected spell requires Concentration, you  
have Advantage on any saving throw you make to  
maintain that Concentration.  
Heightened Spell  
Cost: 2 Sorcery Points  
When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make  
a saving throw, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to  
give one target of the spell Disadvantage on saves  
against the spell.  
Quickened Spell  
Cost: 2 Sorcery Points  
When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an  
action, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to change  
the casting time to a Bonus Action for this casting.  
You can’t modify a spell in this way if you’ve already  
cast a level 1+ spell on the current turn, nor can you  
cast a level 1+ spell on this turn after modifying a  
spell in this way.  
Seeking Spell  
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point  
If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you  
can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll the d20, and you  
must use the new roll.  
You can use Seeking Spell even if you’ve already  
used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.  
Subtle Spell  
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point  
When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery  
Point to cast it without any Verbal, Somatic, or Material components, except Material components that  
are consumed by the spell or that have a cost specified in the spell.  
Transmuted Spell  
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point  
When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage  
from the following list, you can spend 1 Sorcery  
Point to change that damage type to one of the  
other listed types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Thunder.  
Twinned Spell  
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point  
When you cast a spell, such as Charm Person, that  
can be cast with a higher-level spell slot to target an  
additional creature, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point  
to increase the spell’s effective level by 1.  
Sorcerer Spell List  
This section presents the Sorcerer spell list. The  
spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed.  
In the Special column, C means the spell requires  
Concentration, R means it’s a Ritual, and M means it  
requires a specific Material component.

Sorcerer Subclass: Draconic  
Sorcery  
Breathe the Magic of Dragons  
Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon.  
Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed  
some of its magical power to you or your ancestor.  
You might have absorbed magic from a site infused  
with dragons’ power. Or perhaps you handled a  
treasure taken from a dragon’s hoard that was  
steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a  
dragon for an ancestor.  
Level 3: Draconic Resilience  
The magic in your body manifests physical traits  
of your draconic gift. Your Hit Point maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 whenever you  
gain another Sorcerer level.  
Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like  
scales. While you aren’t wearing armor, your base  
Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.  
70 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Level 3: Draconic Spells  
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the  
Draconic Spells table, you thereafter always have  
the listed spells prepared.  
Draconic Spells  
Sorcerer  
Level Spells  
3 Alter Self, Chromatic Orb, Command,  
Dragon’s Breath  
5 Fear, Fly  
7 Arcane Eye, Charm Monster  
9 Legend Lore, Summon Dragon  
Level 6: Elemental Affinity  
Your draconic magic has an affinity with a damage  
type associated with dragons. Choose one of those  
types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison.  
You have Resistance to that damage type, and  
when you cast a spell that deals damage of that  
type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one  
damage roll of that spell.  
Level 14: Dragon Wings  
As a Bonus Action, you can cause draconic wings to  
appear on your back. The wings last for 1 hour or  
until you dismiss them (no action required). For the  
duration, you have a Fly Speed of 60 feet.  
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again  
until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 3 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use  
of it.  
Level 18: Dragon Companion  
You can cast Summon Dragon without a Material  
component. You can also cast it once without a spell  
slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way  
when you finish a Long Rest.  
Whenever you start casting the spell, you can  
modify it so that it doesn’t require Concentration. If  
you do so, the spell’s duration becomes 1 minute for  
that casting.

Becoming a Warlock …  
As a Level 1 Character  
• Gain all the traits in the Core Warlock Traits table.  
• Gain the Warlock’s level 1 features, which are  
listed in the Warlock Features table.  
As a Multiclass Character  
• Gain the following traits from the Core Warlock  
Traits table: Hit Point Die and training with Light  
armor.  
• Gain the Warlock’s level 1 features, which are  
listed in the Warlock Features table. See the multiclassing rules in “Character Creation” to determine your available spell slots.  
Warlock Class Features  
As a Warlock, you gain the following class features  
when you reach the specified Warlock levels. These  
features are listed in the Warlock Features table.  
Level 1: Eldritch Invocations  
You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of  
forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You gain one invocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome. Invocations are described in the “Eldritch Invocation  
Options” section later in this class’s description.  
Prerequisites. If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For  
example, if an invocation requires you to be a level  
5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you  
reach Warlock level 5.  
Replacing and Gaining Invocations. Whenever  
you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of  
your invocations with another one for which you  
71 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a prerequisite for another invocation that you have.  
When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain  
more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table.  
You can’t pick the same invocation more than once  
unless its description says otherwise.  
Level 1: Pact Magic  
Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact  
with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers.  
The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity  
unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability  
to cast spells. See “Spells” for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use  
those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the  
Warlock spell list later in the class’s description.  
Cantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your  
choice. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you  
can replace one of your cantrips from this feature  
with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.  
When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you  
learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as  
shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.  
Spell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows  
how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock  
spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level  
of those slots, all of which are the same level. You  
regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you  
finish a Short or Long Rest.  
For example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock, you  
have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell  
Charm Person, you must spend one of those slots,  
and you cast it as a level 3 spell.  
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the  
list of level 1+ spells that are available for you  
to cast with this feature. To start, choose two  
level 1 Warlock spells. Charm Person and Hex are  
recommended.  
The number of spells on your list increases as you  
gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells  
column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever  
that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list  
matches the number in the table. The chosen spells  
must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in  
the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When  
you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1–3.  
If another Warlock feature gives you spells that  
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count

against the number of spells you can prepare with  
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as  
Warlock spells for you.  
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you  
gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on  
your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible  
level.  
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting  
ability for your Warlock spells.  
Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus  
as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.  
Level 2: Magical Cunning  
You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At  
the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell  
slots but no more than a number equal to half your  
maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you  
can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.  
Level 3: Warlock Subclass  
You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The  
Fiend Patron subclass is detailed after this class’s  
description. A subclass is a specialization that  
grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For  
the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Warlock level or  
lower.  
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement  
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see  
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you  
qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels  
8, 12, and 16.  
Level 9: Contact Patron  
In the past, you usually contacted your patron  
through intermediaries. Now you can communicate  
directly; you always have the Contact Other Plane  
spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the  
spell without expending a spell slot to contact your  
patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s  
saving throw.  
Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t  
do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest.  
Level 11: Mystic Arcanum  
Your patron grants you a magical secret called an  
arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this  
arcanum.  
You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest  
before you can cast it in this way again.  
As shown in the Warlock Features table, you gain  
another Warlock spell of your choice that can be  
cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels  
13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9  
spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum  
when you finish a Long Rest.  
Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level.  
Level 19: Epic Boon  
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another  
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of  
Fate is recommended.  
Level 20: Eldritch Master  
When you use your Magical Cunning feature, you  
regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots.

73 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
plus another 1d8 per level of the spell slot, and you

Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock  
You can use a Bonus Action to touch a willing creature and perceive through its senses until the end  
of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the  
same plane of existence as you, you can take a Bonus Action on subsequent turns to maintain this  
connection, extending the duration until the end  
of your next turn. The connection ends if you don’t  
maintain it in this way.  
While perceiving through the other creature’s  
senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you can cast spells as if  
you were in your space or the other creature’s space  
if the two of you are within 60 feet of each other.  
Gift of the Depths  
Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock  
You can breathe underwater, and you gain a Swim

it in this way again when you finish a Long Rest.  
Gift of the Protectors  
Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock, Pact of the Tome  
Invocation  
A new page appears in your Book of Shadows when  
you conjure it. With your permission, a creature can  
take an action to write its name on that page, which  
can contain a number of names equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one name).  
When any creature whose name is on the page is  
reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, the  
creature magically drops to 1 Hit Point instead.  
Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit  
from it until you finish a Long Rest.  
As a Magic action, you can erase a name on the  
page by touching it.  
Investment of the Chain Master  
Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Chain  
Invocation

Quick Attack. As a Bonus Action, you can command the familiar to take the Attack action.  
Necrotic or Radiant Damage. Whenever the  
familiar deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing  
damage, you can make it deal Necrotic or Radiant  
damage instead.  
Your Save DC. If the familiar forces a creature to  
make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC.  
Resistance. When the familiar takes damage, you  
can take a Reaction to grant it Resistance against  
that damage.  
Lessons of the First Ones  
Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock  
You have received knowledge from an elder entity  
of the multiverse, allowing you to gain one Origin  
feat of your choice (see “Feats”).  
Repeatable. You can gain this invocation more  
than once. Each time you do so, choose a different  
Origin feat.  
Lifedrinker  
Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock, Pact of the Blade  
Invocation  
Once per turn when you hit a creature with your  
pact weapon, you can deal an extra 1d6 Necrotic,  
Psychic, or Radiant damage (your choice) to the  
creature, and you can expend one of your Hit Point  
Dice to roll it and regain a number of Hit Points  
equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier  
(minimum of 1 Hit Point).

Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock  
You can cast Disguise Self without expending a spell  
slot.  
Master of Myriad Forms

slot.

Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock  
You can cast Jump on yourself without expending a  
spell slot.  
Pact of the Blade  
As a Bonus Action, you can conjure a pact weapon  
in your hand—a Simple or Martial Melee weapon of  
your choice with which you bond—or create a bond  
with a magic weapon you touch; you can’t bond with  
a magic weapon if someone else is attuned to it or  
another Warlock is bonded with it. Until the bond  
ends, you have proficiency with the weapon, and  
you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus.  
Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon,  
you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack  
and damage rolls instead of using Strength or  
Dexterity; and you can cause the weapon to deal  
Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal  
damage type.  
Your bond with the weapon ends if you use this  
feature’s Bonus Action again, if the weapon is more  
than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, or  
if you die. A conjured weapon disappears when the  
bond ends.  
Pact of the Chain  
You learn the Find Familiar spell and can cast it as a  
Magic action without expending a spell slot.  
When you cast the spell, you choose one of the  
normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: Imp, Pseudodragon, Quasit,  
Skeleton, Sphinx of Wonder, Sprite, or Venomous  
Snake (see “Monsters” for the familiar’s stat block).  
Additionally, when you take the Attack action,  
you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow  
your familiar to make one attack of its own with its  
Reaction.  
Pact of the Tome  
Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure  
forth a book in your hand at the end of a Short or  
Long Rest. This Book of Shadows (you determine its  
appearance) contains eldritch magic that only you  
can access, granting you the benefits below. The  
book disappears if you conjure another book with  
this feature or if you die.  
Cantrips and Rituals. When the book appears,  
choose three cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells  
that have the Ritual tag. The spells can be from any  
class’s spell list, and they must be spells you don’t  
already have prepared. While the book is on your  
person, you have the chosen spells prepared, and  
they function as Warlock spells for you.  
Spellcasting Focus. You can use the book as a  
Spellcasting Focus.  
Repelling Blast  
Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip  
That Deals Damage via an Attack Roll  
Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that  
requires an attack roll. When you hit a Large or  
smaller creature with that cantrip, you can push the  
creature up to 10 feet straight away from you.  
Repeatable. You can gain this invocation more  
than once. Each time you do so, choose a different  
eligible cantrip.  
Thirsting Blade  
Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Blade  
Invocation  
You gain the Extra Attack feature for your pact  
weapon only. With that feature, you can attack  
twice with the weapon instead of once when you  
take the Attack action on your turn.  
Visions of Distant Realms  
Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock  
You can cast Arcane Eye without expending a spell  
slot.

You can cast Speak with Dead without expending a  
spell slot.  
Witch Sight  
Prerequisite: Level 15+ Warlock

Warlock Subclass: Fiend Patron  
Make a Deal with the Lower Planes  
Your pact draws on the Lower Planes, the realms of  
perdition. You might forge a bargain with a demon  
lord, an archdevil, or another fiend that is especially  
mighty. That patron’s aims are evil—the corruption  
or destruction of all things, ultimately including  
you—and your path is defined by the extent to  
which you strive against those aims.  
Level 3: Dark One’s Blessing  
When you reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points, you gain  
Temporary Hit Points equal to your Charisma modifier plus your Warlock level (minimum of 1 Temporary Hit Point). You also gain this benefit if someone  
else reduces an enemy within 10 feet of you to 0 Hit  
Points.  
Level 3: Fiend Spells  
The magic of your patron ensures you always have  
certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock  
level specified in the Fiend Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.  
Fiend Spells  
Warlock Level Spells  
3 Burning Hands, Command,  
Scorching Ray, Suggestion  
5 Fireball, Stinking Cloud  
7 Fire Shield, Wall of Fire  
9 Geas, Insect Plague  
Level 6: Dark One’s Own Luck  
You can call on your fiendish patron to alter fate  
in your favor. When you make an ability check or a  
saving throw, you can use this feature to add 1d10  
to your roll. You can do so after seeing the roll but  
before any of the roll’s effects occur.  
You can use this feature a number of times equal  
to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), but  
you can use it no more than once per roll. You regain  
all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.  
Level 10: Fiendish Resilience  
Choose one damage type, other than Force, whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest. You have Resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature.  
Level 14: Hurl Through Hell  
Once per turn when you hit a creature with an  
attack roll, you can try to instantly transport the  
target through the Lower Planes. The target must  
succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your  
spell save DC, or the target disappears and hurtles  
through a nightmare landscape. The target takes  
8d10 Psychic damage if it isn’t a Fiend, and it has the  
Incapacitated condition until the end of your next  
turn, when it returns to the space it previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space.  
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again  
until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a  
Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore  
your use of it.

ExpandinG and rEplacinG a spEllBook  
The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain  
levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you  
might find other spells during your adventures that  
you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a Spell Scroll, for example, and then copy  
it into your spellbook.  
Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find  
a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your  
spellbook if it’s of a level you can prepare and if you  
have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the  
transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells  
in your spellbook.  
Copying the Book. You can copy a spell from  
your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since  
you already know how to cast the spell. You need  
spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the  
copied spell.  
If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same  
procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you  
have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the  
remainder of the new book requires you to find new  
spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a  
backup spellbook.  
When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn  
another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in  
the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table.  
Spellbook. Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your  
spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds,  
contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or  
someone casting Identify. You determine the book’s  
appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome  
or a collection of vellum bound with twine.  
The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It  
starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice.  
Detect Magic, Feather Fall, Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Sleep, and Thunderwave are recommended.  
Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two  
Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each  
of these spells must be of a level for which you have  
spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table.  
The spells are the culmination of arcane research  
you do regularly.  
Spell Slots. The Wizard Features table shows  
how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+  
spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.  
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list  
of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast  
with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from  
your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level  
for which you have spell slots.  
The number of spells on your list increases as you  
gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells  
column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that  
number increases, choose additional Wizard spells  
until the number of spells on your list matches the  
number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a  
level for which you have spell slots. For example, if  
you’re a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells  
can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.  
If another Wizard feature gives you spells that  
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count  
against the number of spells you can prepare with  
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as  
Wizard spells for you.  
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you  
finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with  
spells from your spellbook.  
Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.  
Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus  
or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your  
Wizard spells.  
Level 1: Ritual Adept  
You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has  
the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You  
needn’t have the spell prepared, but you must read  
from the book to cast a spell in this way.  
Level 1: Arcane Recovery  
You can regain some of your magical energy by  
studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short  
Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level  
equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round  
up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher.  
For example, if you’re a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels’ worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell  
slots.  
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again  
until you finish a Long Rest.

skills in which you have proficiency: Arcana, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion.  
You have Expertise in the chosen skill.  
Level 3: Wizard Subclass  
You gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. The  
Evoker subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants  
you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest  
79 System Reference Document 5.2.1

“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you  
qualify. You gain this feature again at Wizard levels  
8, 12, and 16.

feature with another level 1+ spell from the book.  
Level 18: Spell Mastery  
You have achieved such mastery over certain spells  
that you can cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and  
a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting  
time of an action. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level  
without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at  
a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.  
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can study  
your spellbook and replace one of those spells with  
an eligible spell of the same level from the book.  
Level 19: Epic Boon  
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another  
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of  
Spell Recall is recommended.  
Level 20: Signature Spells

signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once at level 3  
without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you  
can’t cast them in this way again until you finish a  
Short or Long Rest. To cast either spell at a higher  
level, you must expend a spell slot.

Wizard Subclass: Evoker  
Create Explosive Elemental Effects  
Your studies focus on magic that creates powerful  
elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame,  
rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning  
acid. Some Evokers find employment in military  
forces, serving as artillery to blast armies from  
afar. Others use their power to protect others, while  
some seek their own gain.  
Level 3: Evocation Savant  
Choose two Wizard spells from the Evocation  
school, each of which must be no higher than level 2,  
and add them to your spellbook for free.  
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new  
level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Evocation school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for  
which you have spell slots.  
Level 3: Potent Cantrip  
Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that  
avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a cantrip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll  
or the target succeeds on a saving throw against the  
cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip’s damage  
(if any) but suffers no additional effect from the  
cantrip.  
Level 6: Sculpt Spells  
You can create pockets of relative safety within the  
effects of your evocations. When you cast an Evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can  
see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1  
plus the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the  
spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.  
Level 10: Empowered Evocation  
Whenever you cast a Wizard spell from the Evocation school, you can add your Intelligence modifier  
to one damage roll of that spell.  
Level 14: Overchannel  
You can increase the power of your spells. When  
you cast a Wizard spell with a spell slot of levels 1–5  
that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage  
with that spell on the turn you cast it.  
The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a  
Long Rest, you take 2d12 Necrotic damage for each  
level of the spell slot immediately after you cast it.  
This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity.  
Each time you use this feature again before finishing a Long Rest, the Necrotic damage per spell level  
increases by 1d12.
