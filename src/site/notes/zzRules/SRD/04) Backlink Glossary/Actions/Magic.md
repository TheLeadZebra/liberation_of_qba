When you take the Magic action, you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action or use a feature or magic item that requires a Magic action to be activated.

If you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 minute or longer, you must take the Magic action on each turn of that casting, and you must maintain [[zzRules/SRD/04) Backlink Glossary/Rules/Concentration\|Concentration]] while you do so. If your Concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you donâ€™t expend a spell slot.
