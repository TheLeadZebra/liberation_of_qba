If you take the Dodge action, you gain the following benefits: until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has [[zzRules/SRD/04) Backlink Glossary/Rules/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with [[zzRules/SRD/04) Backlink Glossary/Rules/Advantage\|Advantage]].

You lose these benefits if you have the [[zzRules/SRD/04) Backlink Glossary/Conditions/Incapacitated\|Incapacitated]] condition or if your [[zzRules/SRD/04) Backlink Glossary/Rules/Speed\|Speed]] is 0.
