Equipment fetches half its cost when sold. In contrast, trade goods and valuables—like gems and art  
objects—retain their full value in the marketplace.  
“Magic Items” has prices for magic items.

Coins  
Characters often find coins on their adventures  
and can spend those coins in shops, inns, and other  
businesses. Coins come in different denominations  
based on the relative worth of their material. The  
Coin Values table lists coins and how much they’re  
worth relative to the Gold Piece, which is the game’s  
main coin. For example, 100 Copper Pieces are  
worth 1 Gold Piece.  
A coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty  
coins weigh a pound.

Weapons  
The Weapons table in this section shows the game’s  
main weapons. The table lists the cost and weight of  
each weapon, as well as the following details:  
Category. Every weapon falls into a category: Simple or Martial. Weapon proficiencies are usually  
tied to one of these categories. For example, you  
might have proficiency with Simple weapons.  
Melee or Ranged. A weapon is classified as either  
Melee or Ranged. A Melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet, whereas a Ranged  
weapon is used to attack at a greater distance.  
Damage. The table lists the amount of damage a  
weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well  
as the type of that damage.  
Properties. Any properties a weapon has are listed  
in the Properties column. Each property is defined in the “Properties” section.  
Mastery. Each weapon has a mastery property,  
which is defined in the “Mastery Properties” section. To use that property, you must have a feature  
that lets you use it.  
Weapon Proficiency  
Anyone can wield a weapon, but you must have  
proficiency with it to add your Proficiency Bonus to  
an attack roll you make with it. A player character’s  
features can provide weapon proficiencies. A monster is proficient with any weapon in its stat block.  
Properties  
Here are definitions of the properties in the Properties column of the Weapons table.  
Ammunition  
You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition  
property to make a ranged attack only if you have  
ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition  
required is specified with the weapon’s range. Each  
attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing  
the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a  
free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a  
fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the  
ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the  
rest is lost.  
Finesse  
When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use  
your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier  
for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the  
same modifier for both rolls.  
Heavy  
You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy  
weapon if it’s a Melee weapon and your Strength  
score isn’t at least 13 or if it’s a Ranged weapon and  
your Dexterity score isn’t at least 13.  
Light  
When you take the Attack action on your turn and  
attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra  
attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn.  
That extra attack must be made with a different  
Light weapon, and you don’t add your ability modifier to the extra attack’s damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a  
Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other  
using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you  
don’t add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the  
damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.  
90 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
iMprovisEd wEapons  
If you use an object—such as a table leg, frying pan,  
or bottle—as a makeshift weapon, see “Improvised  
Weapons” in “Rules Glossary.” Also see those rules  
if you wield a weapon in an unusual way, such as using  
a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack.  
Loading  
You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a  
Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus  
Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the  
number of attacks you can normally make.  
Range  
A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after  
the Ammunition or Thrown property. The range  
lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal  
range in feet, and the second is the weapon’s long  
range. When attacking a target beyond normal  
range, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll. You  
can’t attack a target beyond the long range.  
Reach  
A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you  
attack with it, as well as when determining your  
reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.  
Thrown  
If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can  
throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and  
you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If  
the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability  
modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you  
use for a melee attack with that weapon.  
Two-Handed  
A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when  
you attack with it.  
Versatile  
A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two  
hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with  
the property. The weapon deals that damage when  
used with two hands to make a melee attack.  
Mastery Properties  
Each weapon has a mastery property, which is usable only by a character who has a feature, such as  
Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the  
character. The properties are defined below.  
Cleave  
If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using  
this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with  
the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet  
of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit,  
the second creature takes the weapon’s damage,  
but don’t add your ability modifier to that damage  
unless that modifier is negative. You can make this  
extra attack only once per turn.  
Graze  
If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal  
to the ability modifier you used to make the attack  
roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the  
weapon, and the damage can be increased only by  
increasing the ability modifier.  
Nick  
When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can make it as part of the Attack action instead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra  
attack only once per turn.  
Push  
If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can push  
the creature up to 10 feet straight away from yourself if it is Large or smaller.  
Sap  
If you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature  
has Disadvantage on its next attack roll before the  
start of your next turn.  
Slow  
If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal  
damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit  
more than once by weapons that have this property,  
the Speed reduction doesn’t exceed 10 feet.  
Topple  
If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force  
the creature to make a Constitution saving throw  
(DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the  
attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed  
save, the creature has the Prone condition.  
Vex  
If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you have Advantage on your  
next attack roll against that creature before the end  
of your next turn.

Armor  
The Armor table lists the game’s main armor. The  
table includes the cost and weight of armor, as well  
as the following details:  
Category. Every type of armor falls into a category:  
Light, Medium, or Heavy. The category determines  
how long it takes to don or doff the armor (as  
shown in the table).  
Armor Class (AC). The table’s Armor Class column  
tells you what your base AC is when you wear a  
type of armor. For example, if you wear Leather  
Armor, your base AC is 11 plus your Dexterity  
modifier, whereas your AC is 16 in Chain Mail.  
Strength. If the table shows a Strength score in the  
Strength column for an armor type, that armor  
reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the  
wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher  
than the listed score.  
Stealth. If the table shows “Disadvantage” in the  
Stealth column for an armor type, the wearer has  
Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.  
Armor Training  
Anyone can don armor or hold a Shield, but only  
those with training can use them effectively, as  
explained below. A character’s class and other features determine the character’s armor training.  
A monster has training with any armor in its stat  
block.  
Light, Medium, or Heavy Armor  
If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack  
training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20  
Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you  
can’t cast spells.  
Shield  
You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if  
you have training with it.  
One at a Time  
A creature can wear only one suit of armor at a time  
and wield only one Shield at a time.

Large Vehicles  
The Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles table provides statistics for various types of large vehicles.  
The following notes apply.  
Speed  
A ship sailing against a strong wind moves at half  
speed. In a dead calm (no wind), waterborne ships  
can’t move under sail and must be rowed. Keelboats  
and Rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going  
downstream, add the speed of the current (typically  
3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These  
vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A Rowboat can be carried and  
weighs 100 pounds.  
101 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Crew  
A ship larger than a Keelboat or Rowboat needs a  
crew of skilled hirelings (see “Hirelings” later in  
“Equipment”) to function. The minimum number of  
skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on  
the type of ship, as shown in the table.  
Passengers  
The table lists the number of Small and Medium  
passengers the ship can accommodate using hammocks. A ship outfitted with private accommodations can carry one-fifth as many passengers. A passenger usually pays 5 SP per day for a hammock, but  
prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private  
cabin usually costs 2 GP per day.  
Damage Threshold  
If a vehicle has a damage threshold (see “Rules Glossary”), it’s noted in the table.  
Ship Repair  
Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the  
vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 Hit Point of damage  
requires 1 day and costs 20 GP for materials and labor. If the repairs are made in a location where supplies and skilled labor are abundant, such as a city  
shipyard, the repair time and cost are halved.  
Lifestyle Expenses  
Lifestyle expenses summarize the cost of living in a  
fantasy world. They cover lodging, food, equipment  
maintenance, and other necessities.  
At the start of each week or month (GM’s choice),  
choose a lifestyle below—Wretched, Squalid, Poor,  
Modest, Comfortable, Wealthy, or Aristocratic—and  
pay the price to sustain that lifestyle.  
Lifestyles have no inherent consequences, but the  
GM might take them into account when determining  
risks or how others perceive your character.  
Wretched (Free)  
You survive via chance and charity. You’re often  
exposed to natural dangers as a result of sleeping  
outside.  
Squalid (1 SP per Day)  
You spend the bare minimum for your necessities.  
You might be exposed to unhealthy conditions and  
opportunistic criminals.  
Poor (2 SP per Day)  
You spend frugally for your necessities.  
Modest (1 GP per Day)  
You support yourself at an average level.  
Comfortable (2 GP per Day)  
You spend modestly for your necessities and enjoy a  
few luxuries.  
Wealthy (4 GP per Day)  
You’re accustomed to the finer things in life and  
might have servants.  
Aristocratic (10 GP per Day)  
You pay for the best and might have a staff that supports your lifestyle. Others notice your wealth and

Hirelings  
Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform  
a service that involves a proficiency (including  
weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, an artisan, a  
scribe, or the like. The pay shown on the Hirelings  
table is a minimum; some expert hirelings require  
more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for work  
that requires no particular proficiencies; they include laborers and porters.

Spellcasting  
Most settlements contain individuals who are willing to cast spells in exchange for payment. If a spell  
has expensive components, add the cost of those  
components to the cost listed in the Spellcasting  
Services table. The higher the level of a desired  
spell, the harder it is to find someone to cast it.

Magic Items  
Adventures hold the promise—but not a guarantee—of finding magic items. Hundreds of magic  
items are detailed in “Magic Items” later in this document. Here’s what you need to know about using  
magic items.  
Identifying a Magic Item  
Some magic items are indistinguishable from their  
nonmagical counterparts, while others are conspicuously magical. Handling a magic item is enough to  
give you a sense that it is extraordinary, but learning a magic item’s properties isn’t automatic.  
The Identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an  
item’s properties. Alternatively, you can focus on  
one magic item during a Short Rest while being in  
physical contact with the item. At the end of the  
rest, you learn its properties and how to use them  
(but not any curse the item might bear).  
Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties. The command word to activate a ring might  
be etched inside the band, or a feathered design  
might hint that it’s a Ring of Feather Falling.  
Wearing or experimenting with an item can also  
offer hints about its properties. In the specific case  
of Potions, a little taste is enough to tell the taster  
what a potion does. Other items might require more  
experimentation. For example, if your character  
puts on a Ring of Swimming, the GM might say, “Your  
movement feels strangely fluid.” Perhaps you then  
dive into a river to see what happens. The GM would  
then say you swim unexpectedly well.  
Attunement  
Some magic items require a creature to form a  
bond—called Attunement—with them before the  
creature can use an item’s magical properties. Without becoming attuned to an item that requires Attunement, you gain only its nonmagical benefits unless its description states otherwise. For example, a  
magic Shield that requires Attunement provides the  
benefits of a normal Shield if you aren’t attuned to  
it, but none of its magical properties.  
Attune during a Short Rest  
Attuning to an item requires you to spend a Short  
Rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can’t be the same Short Rest  
used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can  
take the form of weapon practice (for a Weapon),  
meditation (for a Wand), or some other appropriate  
activity. If the Short Rest is interrupted, the Attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the  
Short Rest, you’re attuned to the magic item and can  
access its full magical capabilities.  
No More Than Three Items  
You can be attuned to no more than three magic  
items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth  
item fails; you must end your Attunement to an item  
first. Additionally, you can’t attune to more than  
one copy of an item. For example, you can’t attune to  
more than one Ring of Protection at a time.  
Ending Attunement  
Your Attunement to an item ends if you no longer  
satisfy the prerequisites for Attunement, if the item  
has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24  
hours, if you die, or if another creature attunes to  
103 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
the item. You can also voluntarily end Attunement  
by spending another Short Rest focused on the item  
unless the item is cursed.  
Wearing and Wielding Items  
Using a magic item’s properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn  
must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on  
feet, gloves on hands, hats and helmets on a head,  
and rings on a finger. Magic armor must be donned,  
a Shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about  
the shoulders. A weapon must be held.  
In most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be  
worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build.  
Magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or  
they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.  
Multiple Items of the Same Kind  
You can’t wear more than one of certain magic  
items. You can’t normally wear more than one pair  
of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair  
of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear,  
or one cloak. The GM might make exceptions.  
Paired Items  
Items that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers,  
gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only  
if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a  
character wearing a Boot of Striding and Springing  
on one foot and a Boot of Elvenkind on the other foot  
gains no benefit from either.  
Crafting Nonmagical Items  
To craft a nonmagical item, you need tools, raw materials, and time, each of which is detailed below. If  
you meet the requirements, you make the item, and  
you can use it or sell it at its normal price.  
Tools  
The “Tools” section of “Equipment” lists which tools  
are required to make certain items. The GM assigns  
required tools for items not listed there.  
You must use the required tool to make an item  
and have proficiency with that tool. Anyone who  
helps you must also have proficiency with it.  
Raw Materials  
To make an item, you need raw materials worth  
half its purchase cost (round down). For example,  
you need 750 GP of raw materials to make Plate  
Armor, which sells for 1,500 GP. The GM determines  
whether appropriate raw materials are available.  
Time  
To determine how many days (working 8 hours a  
day) it takes to make an item, divide its purchase  
cost in GP by 10 (round a fraction up to a day). For  
example, you need 5 days to make a Heavy Crossbow, which sells for 50 GP.  
If an item requires multiple days, the days needn’t  
be consecutive.  
Characters can combine their efforts to shorten  
the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create  
an item by the number of characters working on it.  
Normally, only one other character can assist you,  
but the GM might allow more assistants.  
Brewing Potions of Healing  
A character who has proficiency with the Herbalism  
Kit can create a Potion of Healing. Doing so requires  
using that kit and 25 GP of raw material over the  
course of 1 day (8 hours of work).  
Scribing Spell Scrolls  
A spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll and create a Spell Scroll, using the rules below.  
Time and Cost  
Scribing a scroll takes an amount of time and money  
based on the level of the spell, as shown in the Spell  
Scroll Costs table. For each day of inscription, you  
must work for 8 hours. If a scroll requires multiple  
days, those days needn’t be consecutive.  
Prerequisites for the Scribe  
To scribe a scroll, you must have proficiency in the  
Arcana skill or with Calligrapher’s Supplies and  
have the spell prepared on each day of the inscription. You must also have at hand any Material components required by the spell; if the spell consumes  
its Material components, they are consumed only  
when you complete the scroll. The scroll’s spell uses  
your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.  
Cantrips  
If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the  
scroll works as if the caster were your level.
