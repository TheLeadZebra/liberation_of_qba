You can make an Opportunity Attack when a creature that you can see leaves your reach using its action, its Bonus Action, its Reaction, or one of its speeds. To make the Opportunity Attack, take a Reaction to make one melee attack with a weapon or an [[zzRules/Basic Rules (SRD)/04) Backlink Glossary/Rules/Unarmed Strike\|Unarmed Strike]] against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.
