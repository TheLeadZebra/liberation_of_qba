If a player suggests that their character is to embark on a task which everyone can see will go either *incredibly well* or *terribly poorly* then the power of ***Rolling with Emphasis*** may be invoked.

To Roll with Emphasis, roll 2d20 and take the result which is *furthest away* from 10 greatly increasing the chance of rolling a 1 or a 20. If you roll 2 numbers which are equidistant from, roll again.
