Each player places a bet, bets must be matched by all participants.

Each player then rolls a d20.

The participant with the highest roll wins, unless:
- Any participant has rolled a 13, they automatically lose
- Any participant has rolled a 7, they automatically win

The pot is split evenly among any joint winners.
