Life and death is a dice game played between the house (represented by a dealer) and a player. While up to five players can sit at a table, their only opponent is the house.

Any one table has a set ante, which could be 1cp, 5cp, 1sp, 1gp, or 10gp.

To play, each player places a bet; once bets have been placed, the house and the players each roll a d20, then:
1. A player rolls lower than the dealer, the house wins.
2. A player who rolls higher than the dealer reclaims the money they bet and wins that same amount from the house.
3. **War -*** A player who ties with the house has two options:
	- The player can surrender and lose half of their bet
	- The player can "go to war", in which case the player must double their bet, and then the player and the dealer both roll again.
4. ***Push your luck -*** When a player wins a roll of life and death, they can opt to push their luck on their next bet. In this case, they bet everything they won on the last roll (their ante plus their winnings from the house). If they win, the house pays double their bet.
