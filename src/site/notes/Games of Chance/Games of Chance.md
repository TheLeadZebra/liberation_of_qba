### Copper Slots
These slot machines are simple clockwork devices that accept copper coins. Some refer to playing a slot machine as "Tugging [[The World/Deities#Astilabor\|Astilabor]]'s Arm".
Each machine has a spring-loaded lever and five identical spinning cylinders called reels.
Six golden, themed runes are painted on each reel.

A player may insert from 1 to 9 copper coins into the machine's slot and pulls the level, which causes the reels to spin, stop, and display a row of five runes.
The player wins by matching three or more runes.

To determine the result of a pull, have the player roll 5d6 (the dice represent the five reels of runes). 
The players goal is to roll as many of the same number on the dice as possible.

The payout, if any, varies according to the results, as shown in the Copper Slots Payout table below.

### Dice Nice Dice (DnD)
Each player places a bet, bets must be matched by all participants.

Each player then rolls a d20.

The participant with the highest roll wins, unless:
- Any participant has rolled a 13, they automatically lose
- Any participant has rolled a 7, they automatically win

The pot is split evenly among any joint winners.

### Life and Death
Life and death is a dice game played between the house (represented by a dealer) and a player. While up to five players can sit at a table, their only opponent is the house.

Any one table has a set ante, which could be 1cp, 5cp, 1sp, 1gp, or 10gp.

To play, each player places a bet; once bets have been placed, the house and the players each roll a d20, then:
1. A player rolls lower than the dealer, the house wins.
2. A player who rolls higher than the dealer reclaims the money they bet and wins that same amount from the house.
3. **War -*** A player who ties with the house has two options:
	- The player can surrender and lose half of their bet
	- The player can "go to war", in which case the player must double their bet, and then the player and the dealer both roll again.
4. ***Push your luck -*** When a player wins a roll of life and death, they can opt to push their luck on their next bet. In this case, they bet everything they won on the last roll (their ante plus their winnings from the house). If they win, the house pays double their bet.

### Three-Dragon Ante
Three dragon ante is played using an actual three-dragon ante card set - or otherwise can be played using d12s, and the following rules:

1. Randomly decide which participant is the dealer.
2. Each participant (including the dealer) places their opening bet, then rolls 5d12s to determine their hands, keeping these die rolls hidden from the other participants.
3. Starting to the left of the dealer and continuing counter clockwise, each participant reveals one of their dice rolls.
	a. This step is then repeated twice more.
		i. On the second and third round, each participant can raise their bet before revealing their next die roll.
		ii. The other participants then have three options: Match the bet, raise their bet (in which case all participants must match that bet in turn), or fold, forfeiring any bet they've placed and dropping out of the game.
4. Each participant who hasn't folded totals their die rolls. The one with the highest total wins. The winner becomes the dealer for the next game (assuming the participants want to keep playing).
