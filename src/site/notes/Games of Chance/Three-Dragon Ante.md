Three dragon ante is played using an actual three-dragon ante card set - or otherwise can be played using d12s, and the following rules:

1. Randomly decide which participant is the dealer.
2. Each participant (including the dealer) places their opening bet, then rolls 5d12s to determine their hands, keeping these die rolls hidden from the other participants.
3. Starting to the left of the dealer and continuing counter clockwise, each participant reveals one of their dice rolls.
	a. This step is then repeated twice more.
		i. On the second and third round, each participant can raise their bet before revealing their next die roll.
		ii. The other participants then have three options: Match the bet, raise their bet (in which case all participants must match that bet in turn), or fold, forfeiring any bet they've placed and dropping out of the game.
4. Each participant who hasn't folded totals their die rolls. The one with the highest total wins. The winner becomes the dealer for the next game (assuming the participants want to keep playing).
