These slot machines are simple clockwork devices that accept copper coins. Some refer to playing a slot machine as "Tugging [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods#Astilabor\|Astilabor]]'s Arm".
Each machine has a spring-loaded lever and five identical spinning cylinders called reels.
Six golden, themed runes are painted on each reel.

A player may insert from 1 to 9 copper coins into the machine's slot and pulls the level, which causes the reels to spin, stop, and display a row of five runes.
The player wins by matching three or more runes.

To determine the result of a pull, have the player roll 5d6 (the dice represent the five reels of runes). 
The players goal is to roll as many of the same number on the dice as possible.

The payout, if any, varies according to the results, as shown in the Copper Slots Payout table below.
