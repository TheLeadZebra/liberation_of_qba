Welcome to the wikisite for A Crown of Thorn, a D&D campaign.

The idea of this site is not so that you will know everything that is coming up, but so that you may know the sort of things your character may know. Use the information here for building a character background but there's no need to memorise everything, or even anything if that's your preference.

If you feel like it, start here: [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/Known Information\|Known Information]]. **Note:** May not be updated with most recent information so do ask if you have questions!

Otherwise, the menu is on the left.

There are a lot of work in progress articles, but I usually fill out at least one a day so far. 
***Obligatory statement that everything is fluid until it hits the table***


>[!Caution] 
>Seems like if you try and close a folder in the menu it breaks, not sure why, so just don't do that I guess? If you do, a refresh should work. It's a bug translating from software to website it seems.

>[!note]
>If you find a link that doesn't lead anywhere do let me know, I probably forgot to tag it for publish, but it could be that the page is secret 🤐
