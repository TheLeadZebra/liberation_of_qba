Drakenholm is the main, and only, city of [[The Island of Q'ba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]] and has the highest density of population of any location by a significant margin. 
Most of the sentient races on the island have at least a small grouping of individuals within the city, which has led to pockets of stylistic variety among the buildings.

The city itself is home to [[The Castle\|The Castle]], the home of [[The Crown\|The Crown]] and is the location in which [[The Council of The Crown\|The Council of The Crown]] convenes in order to advise their leader on ideas of finances, military, etc as well as concerns of the general population. [[The Castle\|The Castle]] itself is a symbol of power and oppulence, the tallest structure by far in the city and only beaten in height by [[The Island of Q'ba/Island Regions/Astilabor's Peak\|Astilabor's Peak]] itself. 

300 years ago Drakenholm was the battleground of a civil war. At the time [[The Crown\|The Crown]] was passed down through [[Succession of The Crown\|Succession]], to a person chosen to be most worthy who was a common man. This was much to the displeasure of the ruler's son, who considered themselves a rightful heir and was insulted that the noble would be found lacking. This led to a battle between noble and common folk, and the subsequent damage or destruction of large swathes of the city. Today known as [[Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Old Town\|Old Town]], this district remains the last standing section of the city built by the [[City Founders\|City Founders]]. All other districts are built in the location of destroyed or irrepairable sections, which have more modern ammenities and distinctive style. 

Modern Drakenholm is split into 7 main districts, as well as [[The Castle\|The Castle]], and also includes the farming town of [[Ravenstone Bridge\|Ravenstone Bridge]] which sits below it's plateau to the south-west.
