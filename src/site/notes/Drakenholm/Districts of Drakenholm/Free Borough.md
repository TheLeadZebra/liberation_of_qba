Free Borough is a district of [[Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]]. Sitting between [[Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Beggars Gate\|Beggars Gate]] and [[Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Old Town\|Old Town]], and running alongside [[Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Dragonhill Mile\|Dragonhill Mile]], Free Borough is the central hub of temples and guilds. All of the island [[Definitions/Gods/Deity\|deities]] have their own temple in the city, as well as any number that exist within their designated [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/The Gods of The Island/The Four Cardinal Gods/The Four Cardinal Gods\|regions]] across [[The Island of Q'ba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]].

During times of civil unrest within the last decade, temples to deities considered to align with negative traits within this city have been targeted with assaults and vandalism.
