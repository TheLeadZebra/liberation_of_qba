Old Town is a district of [[Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]]. As the name suggests it is the oldest section of the city, having been built at the time of the cities founding. Much of the city, as it stood then, has since been destroyed during a battle over [[Succession of The Crown\|Succession]], Old Town is all that remains. 

The district is considered the [[Commoners\|Commoners]] district, because of it's age it was not built with the modern levels of population in mind. This has led to many attempts at retrofitting buildings, and filling small spaces and narrow alleys with extra living spaces, leading to the district now seeming overcrowded and labyrinthine.
