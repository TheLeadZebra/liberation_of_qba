The Dragonborn are one of many races that live in this world. Whist Dragonborn herald from many lands, on the island of [[The Island of Q'ba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]], they are considered natives. Generations of Dragonborn have called the island home, and while few may have moved here from [[Far-off Lands\|Far-off Lands]], most Dragonborn that live on the island were born here. Until [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern the Golden's]] [[Succession of The Crown\|Succession]] of [[The Crown\|The Crown]] to [[Francis Roberts\|Francis Roberts]], all rulers of the island were Dragonborn, though this was understood to be due to the population differences between Dragonborn and other races, there is no reason that a [[Island Races/Non-Human/Non-Human List\|Different Island Race]] may be eligible for rule if the ruler of the time saw fit.

Dragonborn resemble in many ways what their name suggests, they are humanoid-dragons. Standing on average 6'2 Dragonborn are impressively tall, and have a heavy weight of 220-329 pounds. Dragonborn have clawed hands and feet, with a thumb replacing their rear claw on each hand. A Dragonborn's head often features a blunt snout, strong brow and reptilian frills on the cheeks and ears. On the back of their head a crest of hornlike scales formed what resembled a mess of ropy hair. Their eyes are usually red or gold in hue. In rare instances Dragonborn may be born with a tail, though amongst the wider Dragonborn race this is considered a deformity. 

Dragonborn exhibit many dragon-like qualities, including a scaly hide, large muscular body and their ability to use a Breath Weapon, with resistance to the same elemental energy they can breath, dictated by their ancestry and denoted by the colour of their scales, however, the colour of their scales does not correlate to their ancestry. Meaning a Red Dragonborn may bare a White Dragonborn child. Whilst it Dragonborn of different ancestries can interbreed among them, it is generally known that Dragonborn cannot breed with members of other humanoid species.

Dragonborn, though often mistaken for reptiles, are in fact warm-blooded draconic creatures. Their internal temperature is warmer than that of humans, and so commonly feels feverish to the touch of other races. While many would see this as disadvantageous, their lack of hair and large mouth enable them to displace heat easily. This means that they are able to live comfortably in areas of cold which would be uncomfortable to many, but also remain no more vulnerable to heat.

Dragonborn mature very quickly, reaching the equivalent maturity of a human 10 year old, by the age of 3, however maturity rate then slows significantly and they are not considered physically mature until the age of 12. At this point their bodies have reached their adult height and appearance. By this point, generally, a Dragonborn will have developed their Breath Weapon, if they were to develop it at all. Those who do not develop a breath weapon often manifested their draconic heritage in a different way: evoking the dragon's frightful presence, forcing others into a panic. This was known as Dragonfear. At the age of 15 they are considered legal adults in Dragonborn society, at this point they could expect a lifespan equivalent to [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Humans]], of around 80 years.

Dragonborn have a deep dedication to honour and tended to view all living things, even hated enemies, as deserving of courtesy and respect. For this reason, cowardice among Dragonborn was considered a repulsive trait. The draconic nature of Dragonborn gives them a strong self-consciousness and a tendency towards strong emotions. Dragonborn place great value on their skills, and as a result failure of a task is hated by dragonborn and as a result they sometimes push themselves to unhealthy extremes of effort. However on the island of [[The Island of Q'ba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]], many dragonborn have managed to take up a slightly more laid back approach to life due without the need to compete. This does not mean that they do not put effort into themselves, just that they are able to find pride in more menial tasks such as tidiness, or gardening as opposed to being the best performer in the land. Of course, this does not extend to every individual and a skilled dragonborn is loathe to miss an opportunity to show off their abilities.

Dragonborn, by nature, have a variety of ancestries, each described by the colour of their scales and indicative of their elemental affinity. Though these ancestries do derive from individual homelands, any Dragonborn who wish to live on the island are welcome.
