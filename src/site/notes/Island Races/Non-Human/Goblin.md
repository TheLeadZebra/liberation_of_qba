Goblins are a race of small humanoids that commonly live in underground caverns just below the surface, known as lairs. 
Commonly the goblins are subservient to other Goblinoids, most often Hobgoblins, however the Goblins that live on [[The Island of Qba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]] are the only form of Goblinoid. The Goblins are typically confined to the region of [[The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Astilabor's Peak\|Astilabor's Peak]], where they harvest the earth for it's abundant resources. Though they are famous for their rivalry with [[Island Races/Non-Human/Dwarf\|Dwarves]] it seems that here, on the island of [[The Island of Qba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]], the two races work in cooperation, and often to a benefit of both races.

Goblins are known for being around 3.5ft tall on average, with flat faces, sloped foreheads, broad noses, pointed ears and small, sharp fangs. Their eyes vary in colour, from red to yellow and their skin colour ranges from yellow through shades of orange, all the way to a deep red, however it is not uncommon to find Goblins in shades of green. Generally all members of the same tribe share the same coloured skin. Typically, Goblins dress in dark leathers which are soiled by poor hygiene, often they are dyed similar colours to their skin.

Goblins have a short temper and are usually much more easily provoked than many other races, they find it difficult to overcome this short fuse. Their sense of greed makes it difficult to act altruistically, and take pleasure in exacting revenge once crossed. Young Goblins are taught from a young age to be aggressive and ruthless in order to survive, to only rely on themselves, and believe in removing potential rivals before they become a threat. 

In combat, Goblins are adept in making use of any advantages they may have in response to constantly being bullied by larger creatures. Goblins are elusive and nimble, enabling them to slip away from danger more easily than most and excel at guerilla warfare. Often their sheer numbers allow them to flank lone combatants. On the other hand retreat or surrender is the most common response to being outmatched. Some are even known to domesticate Worgs.
