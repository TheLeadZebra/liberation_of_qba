Elf, or Elves, is the term for a number of closely related and long-living races, generally of whom are known to excel in magic.

Though each race has a number of their own traits, there are some features which trend among all of them. By [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Human]] standards, elves tended to be regarded as fair and beautiful, as well as graceful, though they were considered to be frail as well. Elves were often fairly tall, between 5'4 and 6'0 on average, and weighing 59-77kg. Usually true elves were naturally slender and athletic. Naturally, elves had similar ranges of complexions to [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Humans]], with Wood Elves typically copper, or pale-skinned, and Wild Elves often having darker pigmentations. 

Elves commonly had strong, but swiftly passing emotions, being easily moved to laughter, anger or misery and yet just as quickly calmed. They are known for their impulsive behaiviour and, as a result, many other races see them as flighty or impetuous. Yet, depite their whimsical nature, they were typically very responsible. Due to their long lifespan, elves possess a very different perspective on life, often not treating matters as seriously as other races, but whe a threat they recognise does arise , elves are strong friends and loyal to those they call allies. 

Elves are relaxed people, with a good degree of patience, and were not as easily excited or greedy as other, shortlived races. Most elves were unconcerned with events that only affected the short-term and were likewise slow to make friends or enemies since time for them was measured in centuries, not decades. Most elves love simple joys such as dancing, singing, footraces or contests of skill, yet they also have a natural aversion to that which they saw as uninteresting.

The elves that live on the island are a Druidic Circle of Wild Elves, a subrace of Sylvan Elves known for their nomadic nature, preferring a wild existance which is close to nature. They have settled within the forest of [[The Island of Q'ba/Island Regions/Dimmafall\|The Island of Q'ba/Island Regions/Dimmafall]].
