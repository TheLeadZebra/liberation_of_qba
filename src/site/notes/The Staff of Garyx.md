A 2 foot-long rod, made of an unknown metallic material which was discovered in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]] by [[The World/Notable People/Noble Houses/House Sasarum/House Sasarum\|Olanya and Pietro Sasarum]]. 

The rod is known to attract and conduct lightning. The Sasarum's believe that the rod could also be used to control the lightning that it attracts, if wielded by a powerful magic user, however this is only a theory which the Sasarum have not attempted to prove or disprove. Instead the Staff was displayed in the home of [[The World/Notable People/Noble Houses/House Sasarum/House Sasarum\|House Sasarum]] as a decorative piece which they loved to show to guests.
