To link to a heading within Obsidian you must start the link with a #, for example "#Heading Name".
However linking to a heading in a different note requires you to tell obsidian where that heading exists before the #, for example "Note Name#Heading Name" - doing it this way is the correct way to create a heading link in vercel, whether you are linking to a heading within the same note, or a different one.

#### Linking to Heading Within the Same Note
Works in Obsidian only;
[[#Linking to Heading Within the Same Note]]
Works in Obsidian and Vercel;
[[Linking to Note Headings#Linking to Heading Within the Same Note\|Linking to Note Headings#Linking to Heading Within the Same Note]]

##### Linking to Heading Within another Note
Works in Obsidian and Vercel;
[[New Note#Example Heading\|New Note#Example Heading]]

In order to make the link look nicer, you can add the vertical bar syntax (|) to modify the shown text;
"Linking to Note Headings#Linking to Heading Within the Same Note|Custom Link"
Shows;
[[Linking to Note Headings#Linking to Heading Within the Same Note\|Custom Link]]
