King Francis Roberts, a human and often known as 'The Foreign' as a term of endearment, is the current [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/The Rule of Q'ba/The Crown\|Crown]] of the island of [[The Island of Q'ba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]], and the first non-[[Island Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] to hold the title. He is a powerful wizard and the leader of a [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Human]] research expedition which settled on the island over 40 years ago, granted the right to live on the island by [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/The Rule of Q'ba/Previous Rulers/Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta\|Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta]] who was [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/The Rule of Q'ba/The Crown\|The Crown]] at the time. No findings have been published on their research to this date.

As the leader of the [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Human]] group on the island, he spent a lot of time in discussion with [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/The Rule of Q'ba/Previous Rulers/Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta\|Greenscale]] and his son, [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/The Rule of Q'ba/Previous Rulers/Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta]], with a lot of technological knowlege shared from the [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Humans]] to the island folk. Being closer in age to [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/The Rule of Q'ba/Previous Rulers/Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern]] than [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/The Rule of Q'ba/Previous Rulers/Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta\|Draumur]], a strong bond formed between the two of them and shortly after [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/The Rule of Q'ba/Previous Rulers/Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern's]] [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/The Rule of Q'ba/The Crown Traditions/Succession of The Crown\|Succession]], Francis was admitted to [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/The Rule of Q'ba/The Crown Councils/The Council of Emperor Ygerdern the Golden\|The Council of Emperor Ygerdern the Golden]], breaking a tradition of the island to form a council of only three members, known as [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/The Rule of Q'ba/The Crown Traditions/The Three\|The Three]]. 

This position only strengthened the friendship between Francis and [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/The Rule of Q'ba/Previous Rulers/Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern the Golden]], eventually leading to Francis being chosen as the next [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/The Rule of Q'ba/The Crown\|Crown]] of the island, 11 years ago. A year later, Francis performed his first act that would begin a chain of events, eventually turning his reputation from that of a once revered leader, into a ruthless tyrant. 

The first insance was a raising of taxes for all [[Island Races/Non-Human/Non-Human List\|non-humans]] on the island, including the [[Island Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]]. At the same time he installed his own [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/The Rule of Q'ba/The Crown Councils/The Council of King Francis Roberts\|Council]], defying the tradition of [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/The Rule of Q'ba/The Crown Traditions/The Three\|The Three]] in it's entirety. 6 years ago, in response to agression from [[Island Races/Non-Human/Non-Human List\|Non-humans]] the council was relabelled as ***Peacekeepers***. 

Francis has proven himself indifferent to the suffering of [[Island Races/Non-Human/Non-Human List\|non-humans]] and has done nothing to reduce aggression toward them from [[Island Races/Human/Human\|humans]], even going as far as to encourage the damage or destruction of temples to [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/Q'ba's Draconic Pantheon\|Draconic deities]] deemed 'evil' or 'sinful'.

In the last 10 years his nickname 'The Foreign' has been distorted into an insult, and [[NOT FOR PLAYERS/NOT FOR PLAYERS/0.2. Tidbits/The Ballad of Frank the Thorn\|The Ballad of Frank the Thorn]] as a now infamous bards tale, now very much banned from performance across the island.
