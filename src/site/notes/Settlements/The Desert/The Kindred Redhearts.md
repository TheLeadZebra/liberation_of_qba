The Kindred Redhearts are a nomadic clan of Garyx worshippers that live in [[The Island of Q'ba/Island Regions/The Desert\|The Desert]]. Their exact location often moves regularly, but it tends to be within short distance of any oasis. The oasis itself, known as [[The Island of Q'ba/Island Landmarks/The Tears of Garyx\|The Tears of Garyx]], often dries up in the blistering sun of [[The Island of Q'ba/Island Regions/The Desert\|The Desert]] and regularly renews itself in a new location during the aggressive lighting and rain storms that occur nightly. 

The Kindred Redhearts live in caravans and out of carts or tents which are easily taken down and reinnstated at their new location. Whilst a majority of those that live in the clan are [[Island Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] there are also small numbers of [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Humans]], a handful of [[Island Races/Non-Human/Dwarf\|Dwarves]], and a singlular [[Tiefling\|Tiefling]].

Whilst [[The Island of Q'ba/Island Regions/The Desert\|The Desert]] is does not have many resources to harvest the proximity to [[Kin's Landing\|Kin's Landing]] means that there are regular travellers to the camp for trade and entertainment, especially at [[The Travelling Circus\|The Travelling Circus]] Tavern, which is named after the monthly circus event which is put on by the members of the camp.
