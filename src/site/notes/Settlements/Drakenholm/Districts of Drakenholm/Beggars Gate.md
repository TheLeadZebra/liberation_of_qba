Beggars Gate is the entryway district of the city of [[Settlements/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]]. Here city guards defend large gates, and check any traders entering the city for contraband or trespassers. 

This district is the poorest, with tents set up on the interior and exterior of the city walls, filled with citizens who have nowhere else to live. Many of those that live in the squalored conditions are [[Island Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] who have fallen victim to poverty since the introduction of non-human tax increases. Very few are [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Human]].
