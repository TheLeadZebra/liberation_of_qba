The Castle, a spire which sits within the [[Settlements/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Military District\|Military District]] of [[Settlements/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]] in [[The Island of Qba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]]. The building is covered completely in a pattern of dragonscale-like components which glimmer in the sky light. The colour of this glimmer is almost unique depending on your angle of viewing and the time of day, or even night if the moon is particularly bright in the sky.

The Castle is also where [[The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]] of the island lives, protected by the royal guard. The building also contains a handful of governing spaces such as a council room and throne room, which doubles as a court room. The Castle also connects to the City Barracks, Jail and Dungeons as part of the [[Settlements/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Military District\|Military District]].
