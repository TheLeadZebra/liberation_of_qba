Drakenholm is the main, and only, city of [[The Island of Qba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]] and has the highest density of population of any location by a significant margin. 
Most of the sentient races on the island have at least a small grouping of individuals within the city, which has led to pockets of stylistic variety among the buildings.

The city itself is home to [[The Castle\|The Castle]], the home of [[The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]] and is the location in which [[The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Councils/The Council of The Crown\|The Council of The Crown]] convenes in order to advise their leader on ideas of finances, military, etc as well as concerns of the general population. [[The Castle\|The Castle]] itself is a symbol of power and opulence, the tallest structure by far in the city and only beaten in height by [[The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Astilabor's Peak\|Astilabor's Peak]] itself. 

300 years ago Drakenholm was the battleground of a civil war. At the time [[The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]] was passed down through [[The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Traditions/Succession of The Crown\|Succession]], to a person chosen to be most worthy who was a common man. This was much to the displeasure of the ruler's son, who considered themselves a rightful heir and was insulted that the noble would be found lacking. This led to a battle between noble and common folk, and the subsequent damage or destruction of large swathes of the city. Today known as [[Settlements/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Old Town\|Old Town]], this district remains the last standing section of the city built by the City Founders. All other districts are built in the location of destroyed or irrepairable sections, which have more modern ammenities and distinctive style. 

Modern Drakenholm is split into 7 main districts, as well as [[The Castle\|The Castle]], and also includes the farming town of [[Settlements/Drakenholm/Ravenstone Bridge\|Ravenstone Bridge]] which sits below it's plateau to the south-west.
