The Circle of the Shepherd is the name of a group of Druids that have settled within the forest of Dimmafall. 

#### Culture
They have formed particularly strong bonds with beasts of the wild, fey creatures and spirits of the natural world. Individually they are referred to as shepherds.

These druids have made efforts to drive out predatory creatures from their land, admonish greedy hunters who slay more than is required, and, like manu other druids, try to keep the encroachment of civilisation at bay.

#### Abilities
The Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd learn early on how to speak with beasts and fey. They have a fluency in the Sylvan language and come to understand the meaning of gestures, noises, and body language made and exhibited by wild animals.

Some have gained the power to summon nature spirits to their aid, specifically those of either bear, hawks or even unicorns. These spirits may create an aura around them that enhance the abilities of the druid and their allies. Powerful druids may even be able to direct these spirits to help protect their charge animals. Similarly, either the druid or their nature spirit may bolster the life force of any creature that they summoned my magical means. 

The most powerful druids may even call upon their summoned nature spirit to protect them during their times of greatest need. If they are knocked unconscious or otherwise incapacitated, some may find a group of beasts may appear within moments to try and protect them with their lives.
