Ygerdern the Golden is, as his nickname suggests, a [[Island Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Golden Dragon]] and a follower of [[Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Garyx\|Garyx]]. 
Ygerdern the Golden was the last [[The Crown\|Crown]] before [[Francis Roberts\|Francis Roberts]]. He was chosen as [[Succession of The Crown\|Successor]] by his father, [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/Previous Rulers/Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta\|Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta]], for his leadership and his connection with all who live on the island, regardless of race, class, or background. 
Upon his [[Succession of The Crown\|Succession of The Crown]], Ygerdern granted [[Francis Roberts\|Francis Roberts]] a seat on the [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/The Council of Emperor Ygerdern the Golden\|Council]], breaking the tradition of [[The Council of The Crown\|The Three]].
With the cooperation of Ygerdern and [[Francis Roberts\|Francis Roberts]], and [[The Island of Q'ba/History of the Island/Previous Rulers/Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta\|Greenscale]] before him, [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Humans]] provided the [[Island Races/Dragonborn/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] with technological advancements from their homelands, which was one of many [[Far-off Lands\|Far-off Lands]]. This technology included the fields of engineering and medicine, as well as agriculture. This led the [[The Island of Q'ba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]] to have a population boom within the last 40 years. It was this partnership and loyalty shown by [[Francis Roberts\|Francis Roberts]] and the [[Island Races/Human/Human\|Humans]] led to Ygerdern naming [[Francis Roberts\|Francis Roberts]] as his [[Succession of The Crown\|Successor]] to [[The Crown\|The Crown]] upon his death.
