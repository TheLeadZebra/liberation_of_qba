##### 15th Gemsla
I think tomorrow might have to be the day. Since these Imatar-damned taxes have started affecting us non-humans it's been impossible to hold up the business. Even the rich are losing their money, no one wants Kaffilykt when they can barely afford to fill their bellies. That means all this product isn't worth the silver it's canned in.

It will be sad to let everyone go, some of them have grown to be like family. Over the next few days I'll have to see if I can keep the factory running on my own, maybe the reduced overheads will let me break even at least.

##### 18th Gemsla
Can't be done, it's too much for my old bones. Roasting the beans, brewing, capture and canning? I can barely get it done in a day let along go out and sell any of it. I'll sell the last couple days of stock that I have built up and see what fortune that brings. I hope Astilabor looks kindly upon me. I guess I'll update tomorrow.


Me again. 
Wait, the sun is up now so that means...

##### 19th Gemsla
... that this is the right page.

Lots to get through, I'm so excited I can barely keep my pen straight.

Okay, so I went to make sure the lights were off in the break room - force of habit, no one has been in there for a few days - I was...shocked, awed, scared... so many emotions but it was a Klither portal. Right there. A Klithering in my cannery. Upon looking through the portal, everything was gloopy, sticky but curiosity got the better of me, I had to look closer.

I went through the portal and it was like I was a tiny spec of glitter in a humungous, hollow 20-sided dice. In the distance, through the translucent oozy walls, I could see remnants of buildings and intelligent life, but it had all been destroyed by whatever this creature was that I was inside! It was harrowing and enlightening all at once. Life could be wiped out tomorrow by a giant ooze? Well perhaps not in this plane.

I hope.

I digress, next thing I knew I was being bared down upon by one of these ooze creatures, around 20 feet tall and certainly hungry, I ran back towards the doorway. Fortunate that I did, as it was already shrinking away. I dived through, knowing such a gargantuan creature could never fit through.

But, as I swiped the sweat from my brow... The gloopy form reached through the opening and squeezed itself through. I prayed to Tamara that the portal closing would cut it in half and save me, but it did not.

I froze.

The ooze reached for me, grabbing around my hand. I still feel the burning sensation now. But the pain awakened me, as the huge form filled the room I ran for the open space of the factory forgetting that the Goods In and Goods Out doors are completely sealed whilst the factory is shut. 

I was trapped with this monster and I was sure I was done for. However, it is not my ghostly form writing in this journal, so I did indeed survive.

As the ooze entered the factory it seemed to forget about me completely, only caring for the cans of Kaffilykt. It must love the smell of freshly roasted coffee more than any noble on the island, because it could not stop quaffing them down, following them all the way along the conveyer until it reached the top, but here it got stuck. I dare not turn off the machinery for fear of releasing it. 

Instead, I decided to experiment on it; find out what, if anything, I could gain from it. Astilabor must have blessed me with this gift for a reason. I tried to cut into it, but it formed a protective layer making the next slashes much harder. 

In anger I stabbed at it with the end of my knife, but again the outer layer changed to make this action all the more difficult. Again this angered me, so I punched at it, and once again it resisted my next attempt. The same with scalding water and freezing temperatures. I found some static rods, and a vial of acid. Each time it formed a resistive layer. 

On this last attempt, however, something different. Yes it found a way to resist even the acid, but more importantly the effects that let it resist the cutting disappeared, and sure enough it was just as easy to slice as the first time. Though, after this cut it reformed the layer but dropped the next.

Each time I affected it differently it would drop the oldest resistance until I could cut at it again.

The story is almost at an end for today, but I must share a discovery - once again curiosity got the better of me, and I found myself eating a chunk. It didn't burn me like when it engulfed my hand, instead it satiated my hunger. It has been hours yet it feels as though I have just eaten a complete meal. 

Perhaps there is something to be had after all.


##### 27th Gemsla
Much time has passed, I have been too focussed to write.

I reworked the Kaffilykt line to perform all the processes I mentioned in my last entry and it worked, by the time a glob reaches the end of the conveyer it is able to be cut to a square shape.

Using this method I have subsided on nothing but ooze since it's discovery, and yet I appear to remain healthy and feel full. 

Yesterday I went out into the city to peddle my new discovery but sales were slow. I am confident that I will gain traction in time.

##### 5th Null
Today is the Fireday of Null.

I hear his call to me.

Perhaps it was his doing all this time.

Sales and repeat customers are non existent. People do not remain happy eating nothing but ooze and I understand, but when there are no other options... but then again, when they cannot afford other options they cannot pay to keep this factory running either.

Alas, enough being glum, this is my farewell. My house is gone and I cannot afford to keep these doors open any longer.

I have found some old coffee beans and distilled them down to a liquid which should be strong enough to do the job. 

Probably won't be a nice way to go, but I hope it shall be quick.

May Null watch over whoever finds this journal, as I hope he shall watch over me.

##### 6th Null
I woke up today.

That alone is a surprise, but more than that I feel rejuvenated. I felt Null's grip around my arm, and yet I tore myself from it.

It must be the ooze. Perhaps it's resistive qualities caused it to release some kind of... something, but that 'something' appears to have saved my life and filled me with vigour. 

I must do something with this new-found energy!

##### 1st Lautast
I went dancing yesterday. It has been many years, and I didn't even require drink. In my energised state I couldn't help myself!

Today I feel more my usual self. The effects appear to have worn off, yet I am filled with hope. Hopeful that I may be able to capture this essence and pass it on, surely ***this*** shall sell.

##### 2nd Lautast
It is a simple process.

I went to a healer and purchased some medicine. I ensured that it was something strong, one that he stated was vital I not consume too much. "The dose makes the poison" he was sure to quote the old adage. 

The factory has created cubes of the ooze, I just place the poison into a flask and add a cube. You can see it in action, it gets to work so quickly.

The machinery has harvested a lot in this time, I should be able to make plenty for sale tomorrow.


##### 4th Lautast
Sales have been going well, of course there are accusations of being a snake-oil salesman. I expected no less.

But today I had some repeat customers! Maybe this is the turnaround point. I'm not even sure which of the Cardinal Gods to thank anymore.

Thank you all.

##### 5th Lautast
Incredible!
Imagine my luck!
Someone goes ahead and tries to take down The Crown and the city goes into lockdown!

Well, of course, that is all terrible...
But a captive audience! And one on rations! 

Hopefully I will be back to my old situation sooner than I could have ever dreamed just a week ago!

##### 11th Lautast
Business is really good, but I can barely keep up with the mere few dozen orders a day. I think it is time to get some of the old crew back in.

If I can make enough of this stuff maybe I'll even be heralded as a hero for saving the city from starvation. I can only hope for another Klither portal to turn up, who knows what wonders the next may bring!

##### 12th Lautast
I haven't even put out an advert that I'm hiring, but a human woman came in asking for a job. I'm thinking I'll offer to my old pals first before taking on any-

Wait. She has come back already? What is she doing to my machinery? Why am I still writi-
