King Francis Roberts is a human and often given the nickname of 'The Foreign' as a term of endearment. Francis Roberts is the current [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|Crown]] of the island of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] and the first non-[[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] to hold the title. He is a powerful wizard and the leader of a [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Humans/Humans of Q'ba\|Humans of Q'ba]] research expedition which settled on the island. 

In 1449, the expedition landed on the Island of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]]. Disease unfortunately ravaged the ships meaning that barely 200 of the original 500 made it to their destination. One of the individuals known to have died was his wife, though his very young daughter [[Francesca Roberts\|Francesca Roberts]] did survive. Though the citizens of the island were understandably hesitant, the humans were granted the right to live on the island by [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/Previous Rulers/Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta\|Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta]] who was [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]] at the time. However, no findings have been published on their research to this date.

As the leader of the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Humans/Humans of Q'ba\|Humans of Q'ba]] group on the island, he spent a lot of time in discussion with [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/Previous Rulers/Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta\|Greenscale]] and his son, [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/Previous Rulers/Emperor Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Emperor Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta]], with a lot of technological knowledge shared from the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Humans/Humans of Q'ba\|Humans]] to the island folk. Being closer in age to [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/Previous Rulers/Emperor Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern]] than [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/Previous Rulers/Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta\|Draumur]], a strong bond formed between the two of them and shortly after [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/Previous Rulers/Emperor Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern's]] [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Traditions/Succession of The Crown\|Succession]], Francis was admitted to [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Councils/The Council of Emperor Ygerdern the Golden\|The Council of Emperor Ygerdern the Golden]], breaking a tradition of the island to form a council of only three members, known as [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Traditions/The Three\|The Three]]. 

This position only strengthened the friendship between Francis and [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/Previous Rulers/Emperor Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern the Golden]], eventually leading to Francis being chosen as the next [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|Crown]] of the island, 11 years ago. A year later, Francis performed his first act that would begin a chain of events, eventually turning his reputation from that of a once revered leader, into a ruthless tyrant. 

The first instance was a raising of taxes for all [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Non-Human/Non-Human\|non-humans]] on the island, including the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]]. At the same time he installed his own [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Councils/The Council of King Francis Roberts\|Council]], defying the tradition of [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Traditions/The Three\|The Three]] in it's entirety. 6 years ago, in response to aggression from [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Non-Human/Non-Human\|Non-humans]] the council was relabelled as ***Peacekeepers***. 

Francis has proven himself indifferent to the suffering of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Non-Human/Non-Human\|non-humans]] and has done nothing to reduce aggression toward them from [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Humans/Humans of Q'ba\|humans]], even going as far as to encourage the damage or destruction of temples to [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/Q'ba's Draconic Pantheon\|Draconic deities]] deemed 'evil' or 'sinful'.

In the last 10 years his nickname 'The Foreign' has been distorted into an insult. [[xxDMs Notes/NOT FOR PLAYERS/0.2. Tidbits/Ballads/The Ballad of Frank the Thorn\|The Ballad of Frank the Thorn]] has now become and infamous bards tale, which is very much banned from performance across the island.
