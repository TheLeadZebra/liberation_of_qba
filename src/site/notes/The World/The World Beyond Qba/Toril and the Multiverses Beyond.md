Realmspace is the term used to describe the solar system, within which sits the planet [[The World/The World Beyond Qba/Toril and the Multiverses Beyond#Toril\|#Toril]], home of the Forgotten Realms. Realmspace sits on the Prime Material Plane. 
To those on the surface of Toril, Realmspace was called the Sea of Night, while the Netherese referred to it as the Skyward Realms. Contained within a crystal sphere suspended in the enormous expanse of the phlogiston, Realmspace consisted of wildspace (empty vacuum), a sun, eight planets and their satellites, and a variety of asteroids, comets, and nebulae.

### Toril

Toril is the third planet from the Sun within [[The World/The World Beyond Qba/Toril and the Multiverses Beyond#Realmspace\|#Realmspace]]. It is orbited by one moon named Selûne, and by a cluster of asteroids, known as the Tears of Selûne.

Throughout most of its history, Toril was known less commonly as Abeir-Toril. The name "Abeir-Toril" was archaic, meaning "cradle of life" in an extinct and forgotten language. Since the Spellplague it has been revealed that there exists a planetary sibling known as [[The World/The World Beyond Qba/Toril and the Multiverses Beyond#Abeir\|#Abeir]], and the fact that both [[The World/The World Beyond Qba/Toril and the Multiverses Beyond#Abeir\|#Abeir]] and Toril were once united. 


Toril is the planet on which the island of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] exists, home to the Forgotten Realms setting, though the lore is not completely accurate to the published version found in Dungeons and Dragons' Fifth Edition.

Q'ba sits in the Great Sea.

#### Far Off Lands
Any region outside of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] is referred to, in general, as the Far Off Lands.

#### Selûne (Moon)
Selûne, known as Leira to its inhabitants, is the name of Toril and Abeir's only natural moon. Seen from Toril, it appears to fit within the size of a human fist held at arm's length. It is quite bright on a clear night, able to cast pale shadows.

Since the revolution and rotation periods of Selûne's orbit around Toril are the same, only one side of the moon always faces Toril, while the far side (referred to by some as the "dark side") can never be seen from the planet.

The visible side of the moon was disguised by a powerful illusion that makes it appear to be an airless, barren, desolate place filled with craters and valleys. The illusion drifted about 500 miles (800 km) above the surface. It can only be revealed by a wish spell and, even so, only to the caster. The far side, however, is not obscured by any magic, so its true splendor could be seen from space. All docking ports for spelljamming ships are located on the far side.

Selûne is followed in the sky by the [[The World/The World Beyond Qba/Toril and the Multiverses Beyond#Tears of Selûne\|#Tears of Selûne]].

##### Tears of Selûne
From Toril, while Selûne appears to fit within the size of a human fist an arm's length away, the Tears of Selûne extend for almost three handspans wide and three fingers deep at the same distance. From the ground, the Tears appear as stars and are often identified as nine in number (the other bodies that made up the cluster are too indistinct to make out). The Tears are only bright enough to be seen at night, and even then they are not seen every night. The first tear appears above the horizon about four hours after Selûne rises, and it takes about three hours for the entire set of Tears to rise or set.



### Abeir
Abeir is the twin planet to Toril (the main Forgotten Realms world), existing as a "shadow" or parallel world within the same crystal sphere but on a different vibrational plane. It is primarily known as a harsh, "godless" world dominated by tyrannical dragons and ruled by ancient primordials rather than deities.

It is often described as having a steel-colored sky, a result of the residual energy from dead primordials.
Unlike Toril, Abeir lacks the Weave, meaning traditional arcane spellcasting is impossible. Magic is instead derived from elemental power, draconic bloodlines, or direct channeling of primordial energy.
It is the birthplace of the dragonborn, who were enslaved by dragons during the "Rule of Dragons". Other major populations include humans, genasi, and dwarves.
During the Spellplague, Abeir and Toril briefly overlapped, swapping parts of their surfaces (like the continent of Laerakond/Maztica) before the Second Sundering separated them again.
Fey creatures like elves are almost unheard of on Abeir.

### King-Killer Star
The King-Killer Star is a reddish cometary body visible from Toril that was once linked to the Dracorage mythal. Its periodic appearance in the skies of Abeir-Toril caused dragons to go mad with rage, destroying and killing without reason.

The name of the King-Killer Star originated from when the gold dragon known as King Orchrtrien witnessed the red comet and entered into the dracorage. Orchrtrien attacked his loyal subjects, who were forced to kill him in self-defense. While dying, Orchtrien whispered: "The red star murdered me."

Around the year 600, a blue dragon wyrmling named Sparkrender used the passage of the comet to perform a ritual to absorb the power of the great dragons of old that died on Stormwreck Isle. As the King-Killer Star passed close to [[The World/The World Beyond Qba/Toril and the Multiverses Beyond#Toril\|#Toril]] part of the comet, or perhaps a following body, fell into the atmosphere before eventually crashing into The Great Sea.

An attempt was made near the end of the Time of Dragons by dragonkind to destroy the King-Killer Star. The missed shot nicked [[The World/The World Beyond Qba/Toril and the Multiverses Beyond#Selûne (Moon)\|Selûne]] and created the [[The World/The World Beyond Qba/Toril and the Multiverses Beyond#Tears of Selûne\|#Tears of Selûne]]. The dragon Kisonraathiisar learned of this and inscribed it on one of his scales for posterity.
