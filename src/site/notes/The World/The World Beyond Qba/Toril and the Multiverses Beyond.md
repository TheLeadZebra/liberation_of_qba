Realmspace is the term used to describe the solar system, within which sits the planet [[The World/The World Beyond Qba/Toril and the Multiverses Beyond#Toril\|#Toril]], home of the Forgotten Realms. Realmspace sits on the Prime Material Plane. 
To those on the surface of Toril, Realmspace was called the Sea of Night, while the Netherese referred to it as the Skyward Realms. Contained within a crystal sphere suspended in the enormous expanse of the phlogiston, Realmspace consisted of wildspace (empty vacuum), a sun, eight planets and their satellites, and a variety of asteroids, comets, and nebulae.

### Toril

Toril is the third planet from the Sun within [[The World/The World Beyond Qba/Toril and the Multiverses Beyond#Realmspace\|#Realmspace]]. It is orbited by one moon named Selûne, and by a cluster of asteroids, known as the Tears of Selûne.

Throughout most of its history, Toril was known less commonly as Abeir-Toril. The name "Abeir-Toril" was archaic, meaning "cradle of life" in an extinct and forgotten language. Since the Spellplague it has been revealed that there exists a planetary sibling known as [[The World/The World Beyond Qba/Toril and the Multiverses Beyond#Abeir\|#Abeir]], and the fact that both [[The World/The World Beyond Qba/Toril and the Multiverses Beyond#Abeir\|#Abeir]] and Toril were once united. 


Toril is the planet on which the island of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] exists, home to the Forgotten Realms setting, though the lore is not completely accurate to the published version found in Dungeons and Dragons' Fifth Edition.

Q'ba sits in the Great Sea.

Any region outside of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] is referred to, in general, as the Far Off Lands.

### Abeir
Abeir is the twin planet to Toril (the main Forgotten Realms world), existing as a "shadow" or parallel world within the same crystal sphere but on a different vibrational plane. It is primarily known as a harsh, "godless" world dominated by tyrannical dragons and ruled by ancient primordials rather than deities.

It is often described as having a steel-colored sky, a result of the residual energy from dead primordials.
Unlike Toril, Abeir lacks the Weave, meaning traditional arcane spellcasting is impossible. Magic is instead derived from elemental power, draconic bloodlines, or direct channeling of primordial energy.
It is the birthplace of the dragonborn, who were enslaved by dragons during the "Rule of Dragons". Other major populations include humans, genasi, and dwarves.
During the Spellplague, Abeir and Toril briefly overlapped, swapping parts of their surfaces (like the continent of Laerakond/Maztica) before the Second Sundering separated them again.
Fey creatures like elves are almost unheard of on Abeir.
