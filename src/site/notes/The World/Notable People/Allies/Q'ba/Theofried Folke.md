- Has noticed a lot more messages coming to and from Kings landing these days "Something big is going on."

Laid back Courier, often found in uniform with his feet propped up on some kind of furniture, flipping a lucky poker chip.

With a Human mother and Elven father, Theofried has spent plenty of time crossing back and forth across the island, especially between Drakenholm and Kindlewood, specifically on the way through to Circe. 

On the way between one parent's home and the other's there was always someone that wanted a message sent, or an item collected. Theofried never found a good enough reason to stop, especially once he realised people were willing to pay for the service.

Not that he needed the money, his family had done well since settling on the island. If anything he only did the work to get away from the lifestyle, mum wasn't exactly thrilled that her Little One took up the mantle as a meagre delivery boy.

Nothing pleases him more than getting thrown into the street after losing his 'hard earned' allowance on card games, and if he walks out with a few coins still rattling in his pocket? Well that gets spent at the tavern.
