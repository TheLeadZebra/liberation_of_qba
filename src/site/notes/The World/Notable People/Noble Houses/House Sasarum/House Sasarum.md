[[The World/Notable People/Noble Houses/House Sasarum/Olanya Sasarum\|Olanya]] and [[The World/Notable People/Noble Houses/House Sasarum/Pietro Sasarum\|Pietro]] Sasarum grew their wealth as adventuring archaeologists off-island, but their prized possession, and the artifact that cemented their name on the noble tongue of Drakenhom was the discovery made whilst doing some work in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]]. Where they discovered what they dubbed "[[The Staff of Garyx\|The Staff of Garyx]]", a rod of unknown metal which seemed to attract lightning, they theorised that a powerful magic user may even be able to use the rod to direct the lightning wherever they wish. However, this was only ever theorised as the Sasarum considered it more valuable as a show piece among the nobility than a weapon to wield.

Their daughter, [[The World/Notable People/Allies/Q'ba/Olysia Sasarum\|Olysia]], married [[The World/Notable People/Allies/Player Characters/Harold de la Lumieres\|Harold de la Lumieres]] - a wealthy Halfling from [[The World/The World Beyond Qba/Toril/Far-Off Lands/Beluir\|Beluir]] on the [[The World/The World Beyond Qba/Toril/Far-Off Lands/Far-Off Lands\|continent of Faerun]].

Recently this Dragonborn noble house has fallen into destitution due to the high taxes and lowered income. They have begun selling off some of their artifacts that they have gathered through their travels. 

It goes without saying, [[The Staff of Garyx\|The Staff of Garyx]] is off the table, and hidden away.
