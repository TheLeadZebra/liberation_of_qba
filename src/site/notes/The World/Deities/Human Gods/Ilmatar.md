**Symbol** - A pair of white, human hands, bound with a red cord.

Ilmater is the name of the [[The World/Deities/Deities\|Deity]] brought to the island by the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Humans/Humans of Q'ba\|Humans]] upon their arrival to [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]].

Ilmater has many names:
- The Crying God
- The Broken God
- The Lord on the Rack
- The One Who Endures
- Our Martyred Father

He is the God of the suffering, the oppressed and the persecuted. He encourages them to endure, and encourages others to help them by taking their burdens or their place. Ilmater is a willinng sufferer, bearing the pain of others so that they may be spared from it, and it is said that if he had his way he would do it for all the sufferinng in the world.

In his Avatar form, Ilmater appears as a short human man with a burly build wearing only a breechcloth. He has a plain but kind and comforting face, a balding head and a hairy body. His body bears the marks of mutilation and torture on the rack, covered with open cuts, closed scars, burns and a range of other wounds. Ilmater's joints are broken, his limbs ravaged and his hands smashed, yet somehow still functional. Moving, alone, causes his a great deal of pain as he drags himself around. No matter how much his Avatar heals, it always shows these terrible wounds.

Ilmater is the incarnation of compassion, and the eternal foe of suffering. A generous, good spirited and even-tempered deity, with a king and gentle nature. He seeks to offer aid abd relief and words of comfort to those in pain, who were oppressed or otherwise in great need. 

Ilmater does not anger quickly, but when he does he is fearsom in his wrath. He is greatly angered by extreme cruelty and atrocities and by those who inflicted such suffering. Particularly, his rage is great for those who harm or abuse children and other young creatures. He treasured all children and young creatures in general. Yet, Ilmater is the most forgiving of beings if they repent of their cruel deeds, hoping that all evil beings could one day be turned to good, or else destroyed. He is known for a rather rustic sense of humor and likes to hear funny stories.

The humans of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] follow Ilmater, relieving the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] of their oppression by allowing them to serve as aids, or workers to [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Humans/Humans of Q'ba\|Humans of Q'ba]] households or workforces - their labour in return for repayment of debts owed to [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]], or other figures. Of course they were willing to allow any [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Non-Human/Non-Human\|Non-Human]] this same favor, encouraging them to show their appreciation to Ilmater by pushing themselves beyond their body's limitations, as Ilmater himself would.
