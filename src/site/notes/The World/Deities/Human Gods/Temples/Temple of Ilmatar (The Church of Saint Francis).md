*(Image to evoke a feeling, not completely accurate to the real location)*

The temple of [[The World/Deities/Human Gods/Ilmatar\|Ilmatar]] in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]], named The Church of Saint Francis, looks like a large manor house surrounded by protective walls. 

The fairly undecorated and simple interior contains a few rooms, such as a chapel, a chapter house, a small library and an area for treating a few sick or injured people.

The manor grounds also include a stable, garden and a quarters for monks that tend the grounds.

The gardens grow an abundence of Daffodils, the flower is also the symbol of the church.
