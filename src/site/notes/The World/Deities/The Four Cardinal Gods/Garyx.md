*"May the fires wash away your sins"*

Garyx, the chaotic God of Fire, Destruction and Renewal is one of [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/The Four Cardinal Gods\|The Four Cardinal Gods]]. He is the patron of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]] and is responsible for the domains of Tempest and Light. A symbol of sheer power and destructive force, specifically of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonkind]], as well as the cleansing power of fire and flame, as well as lightning. Garyx manifests himself as a huge dragon of bold red, and bronze. 

Respected by both worshippers of destruction and of cleansing, often his followers believe that his fire can sterilise the world from evil, however Garyx often pays little attention to the wants of his followers, yet his Clerics do not worry about this. They believed that he grants them the power to perform acts of destruction, which was enough for them. 

Even on the island of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] Garyx has very few temples outside of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]] in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]], however his symbol will often be found carved beside his followers handiwork. On the otherhand, it was not uncommon for druids to revere Garyx, knowing that sometimes devestation was necessary for rejuvination.
