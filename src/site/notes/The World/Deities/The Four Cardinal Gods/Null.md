**Symbol** - The skull of an ancient dragon

*"May Null watch over you, as you rest"*

Null is one of [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/The Four Cardinal Gods\|The Four Cardinal Gods]]. He is the God of Death and of dead Dragons, as well as the God of undeath. Null holds dominion over [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Stillwater Mire/Stillwater Mire\|Stillwater Mire]] and holds the domains of Death and War. He is the Guardian of the Lost, who ferries the souls of the dead to their intended destinations, especially those who died in battle.

When manifesting himself, Null appears as an impenetrable region of blackness in the shape of a dragon, and his voice is said to be the dusty croak of undead. Legend says that to touch him is to instantly die.

Null is prideful and arrogant, fatalistic and utterly humorless. Though he is not easily angered, he holds grudges which may develop into undying hatred. 

He is worshiped by all [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] of any alignment. Whether a goodly dragon wishes to speed a lost loved one to the afterlife, or an evil one wanted to attack a city with an army of undead, a prayer was said to Null. 

Temples to Null - such as the one in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]] in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]] - often take the form of an underground cavern, cloaked in shadows and dimly lit. Dragons of all breeds and alignments tried to make their way here before they died, and their remains lay strew across the florr, including any treasures the dragons may have had with them or worn. The spirits of these Dragons stayed to guard the temples from any who aimed to steal from the burial pit. 

[[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Tamara\|Tamara]] is known to be resented by Null due to her interference with the inevitability of death.
