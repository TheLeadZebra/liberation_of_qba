*"May you find what you seek"*

Astilabor, one of [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/The Four Cardinal Gods\|The Four Cardinal Gods]], is the Goddess of Acquisitiveness and Wealth. She represents the draconic desire to hoard acquired treasure and wealth, inclusive of knowledge. 

(In this campaign) Astilabor manifests herself as a topaz dragon, shimmering with a purple iridescence, and an underbelly of gold.

While not every follower of Astilabor is a devout spouter of scripture, many [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] engrave her symbol onto their hoard as a form of protective ward. Many who pray to Astilabor offer a share of their gains in return for good favor during their ventures, but never sacrificed what they owed. It was believed that Astilabor would lose respect for them should they give up their wealth so easily.

Her followers were generally mistrusting of followers of trickery and mischief, however Astilabor herself saw these as positive traits when used to take wealth from another, though she did not look kindly on the theft of wealth from her own followers.

Clerics of Astilabor tended to be neutral in alignment, as she had to be confident that they would stand fast in their pursuit of gaining knowledge and acquiring treasures.

Temples to Astilabor, such as the one in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm's]] [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]], are often grand and filled with lavish furnishings, and expensive treasures, such as platinum candleholders and sconces. Each treasure within the temple was always marked clearly with who the owner was, often marked using particular characteristics defining an individual, so as to prove the wealth still belonged to them.

Oftentimes Astilabor is mis-characterized as being a Goddess of Greed, however this is not the case and Astilabor disapproved of [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Tiamat\|Tiamat's]] naked display of it. Astilabor, on rare occasions, gifted a boon from her personal hoard to those who had pleased her.

Astilabor rules over the region of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Astilabors Peak/Astilabors Peak\|Astilabors Peak]] on [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]], the land here is gifted with plentiful gems and precious minerals.

She also resides over the domains of Knowledge and Trickery.
