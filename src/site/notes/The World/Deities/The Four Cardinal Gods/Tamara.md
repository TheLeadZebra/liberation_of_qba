*"May you bathe in her Mercy"*

Tamara is one of [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/The Four Cardinal Gods\|The Four Cardinal Gods]], and the Goddess of life, mercy and forgiveness. Tamara ruled over the region of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall/Dimmafall\|Dimmafall]], and the domains of Life and Nature.

Tamara manifests herself as a wingless Green dragon with burnished edge scales. She radiates a comforting aura. Though the kindest and most benevolent of the draconic deities, it is not a trait which should be mistaken for weakness, those that do often regret making the error. 

Mostly worshipped by [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] aligned with the poison element, as well as many neutral good dragons of other colour, Tamara's faith had a reputation of being peaceful and merciful, however her followers did not hesitate to stand against evil or tyranny if they needed to.

Many of Tamara's clerics are healers, but also deliverers of death to those who tried to escape it. They seek to destroy undead across the lands, in particular draconic undead. Her temples were often also hospitals or places of healing where the ill or injured were welcomes. Terminally ill [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] are cared for with dignity and respect and when dragons died in her temple their passing is greeted with a positive light, as a merciful way to escape the hardships of life.
