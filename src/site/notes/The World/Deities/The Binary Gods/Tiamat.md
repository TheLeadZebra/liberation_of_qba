Tiamat is the dragon goddess of greed, and queen lawful evil dragons.

![Tiamat.png](/img/user/zAttachments/Tiamat.png)
**Symbol -** 5 dragon claws, each a colour matching one of Tiamat's heads. Sometimes 5 Draconic heads are used instead of claws.

#### Form
Tiamat is a unique, 5-headed chromatic dragon, with a head for each of the most common chromatic dragon colours (Black  Blue, Green, Red, White). Each head is able to operate independently of one another and had the powers of the respective race of dragonkind. Her body also has traits similar to that of a wyvern, with a long tail, tipped with a venomous stinger. 

Tiamat has three main avatars;

As *The Chromatic Dragon*, she has stubby legs and five heads, which could be any combination of colours belonging to a chromatic dragon. The skin of each head formed into three stripes- blue-green, grey, and purple, these stripes then merged again to form her brown skin which covered her tail.

*[[The World/Legendary Figures/The Dark Lady\|The Dark Lady]]*, a Mulan woman with long, dark hair and completely black eyes. She always wore robes and often had a seductive smile on her face. 

*The Undying Queen* is a dracolich version of her Chromatic Dragon form.
 
#### Alignment
Tiamat is arrogant, greedy, hateful, spiteful and vain. She never forgives any slight, and is always focussed on gaining more power and wealth. She disdains mortals, regarding them as mere disposable tools in her schemes. When needed she could be charming and fey, but her self-serving and reptilian nature betrays her sooner or later.

Tiamat enjoys the company of dragons, and has many great wyrm consorts of the chromatic varieties. 

She has an insatiable greed for treasures, but prefers that her followers bring them to her rather than searching for riches herself.

Tiamat keep an active watch over evil dragonkind and always stirs them to further actions of avarice, pride and wickedness.

Tiamat is the antithesis of her brother [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]], as both of them represent opposing values, and this enmity is reflected in the attitude of each deity's worshipers as well.

Tiamat also considers [[The World/Deities/Human Gods/Ilmatar\|Ilmatar]] among her list of enemies.

#### Powers
As a unique chromatic dragon with the traits of the five most common chromatic varieties, Tiamat is a foe to be reckoned with in battle.

Along with all the standard powers and godly senses of a deity of her rank, those who saw her fight claimed that her heads are able to cooperate in battle, and that those heads have the ability to use the breath weapons and spell-like abilities common to their species. Although her sheer size prevents claw and kick attacks while on the ground, she is adept at their use while flying. She also has a stinger on her tail that injects a powerful venom on her foes, killing them in agonizing pain.

#### Followers
Many evil dragons have worshipped Tiamat since their species first appeared on [[The World/The World Beyond Qba/Toril/Toril\|Toril]].  [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Kobolds of Q'ba\|Kobolds of Q'ba]] believed she was their creator, though they did not worship her as a god they revered her as their creator. Since the spellplague she has gained some [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] followers. 

The Church of Tiamat is regimented with a strict hierachy of ranks and titles. 

Tiamat only accepts evil clerics. They, like Tiamat herself, seek to place the world under the domination of evil dragons.


#### Temples
With strong ties to all gods in [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/Q'ba's Draconic Pantheon\|Q'ba's Draconic Pantheon]] the island has attracted higher densities of followers to Tiamat than most other places, even going so far as creating a temple within [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]]. Though this temple was quite dark and bare, appearing more as a meeting place for illicit conversation away from prying ears than that of a holy prayer room. 

#### Rites
Whilst not explicitly rituals in themselves, her clerics are constantly occupied by the tasks of acquiring an ever increasing hoard of wealth for the faith, and sabotaging the faiths of other deities. As a result much of their time is spent with an unending series of thefts, assassinations, acts of vandalism, and arson.
