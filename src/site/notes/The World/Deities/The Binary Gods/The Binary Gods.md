The Binary Gods are [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]] and [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Tiamat\|Tiamat]], who brought their presence to the island of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] after a [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/Civil War\|Civil War]] within the city of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]]. 

Though they are more powerful than any of [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods\|The Four Cardinal Gods]] individually, their hold on the island is far less impressive, which much of their focus elsewhere. This however, does not mean those who worship the Binary Gods are small in number, as many on the island recognise the gods of the island as a whole rather than the smaller number who choose a favoured Deity and dedicate themselves wholey towards them. 

The Binary Gods each have their own temple within the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]], as with the other gods of the island.
