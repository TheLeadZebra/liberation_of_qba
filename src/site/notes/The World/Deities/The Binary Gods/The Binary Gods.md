The Binary Gods are [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]] and [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Tiamat\|Tiamat]], who brought their presence to the island of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] after a [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/Civil War\|Civil War]] within the city of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]]. 

Though they are more powerful than any of [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods\|The Four Cardinal Gods]] individually, their hold on the island is far less impressive, with much of their focus elsewhere. This however, does not mean those who worship the Binary Gods are small in number, as many on the island recognise the gods of the island as a whole rather than the smaller number who choose a favoured Deity and dedicate themselves wholly towards them. 

The Binary Gods each have their own temple within the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]], as with the other gods of the island.

### Bahamut
Bahamut is the dragon god of enlightened justice (justice tempered with mercy and punishment with forgiveness) and lawful good dragons. 

![Bahamut Icon.jpg|350](/img/user/zzzAttachments/Bahamut%20Icon.jpg)
**Symbol** - A platinum dragon profiled against a blue background.
#### Form
His natural form is that of a platinum metallic dragon, approximately 180ft (55ft) in total length, with a tail the same length as his body, said by many to be the only one of his kind. His scales are said to be tougher than any shield (some say nearly indestructible) and glow with a feint blue sheen. He also has blue eyes, the exact shade of which shifts depending on Bahamut's mood. Bahamut has been known to wonder the mortal world, taking the appearance of an old human or a demihuman wizard dressed as a peasant accompanied by songbirds. This persona became known among mortals as [[The World/People of the World/Avatars/Fizban the Fabulous\|Fizban the Fabulous]], whom sages believed was designed so as to not frighten non-dragon beings. The sages also believe that he has many other guises as well.

He is the eternal rival of his sister, [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Tiamat\|Tiamat]], queen of the chromatic dragons. 

#### Alignmentment
Bahamut is stern and very disapproving of evil, he accepts no excuses for evil acts, and doesn't tolerate even minor offenses by evil creatures. Yet in spite of this stance, he is also considered one of the most compassionate beings in the multiverse. He has limitless empathy for the downtrodden, the dispossessed and the helpless. He usually preferred to polymorph those who had offended him rather than killing them, Bahamut loathed to sully himself with the blood of even evil creatures. 

By draconic standards, Bahamut is neither vain nor desirous of treasure. Instead he values wisdom, knowledge, prophecies, and songs instead. He uses the great wealth he has amassed over the ages in order to help those in need, using the magic items he has gathered to further his goals.

Bahamut also likes to prove the strength and worthiness of his followers by battling them whilst in his dragon form, halting the combat when his followers are injured or overcame him. However he was known to get carried away by his zeal, and had powerful healers on hand in case he gravely injured one of his followers in those battles. 

Bahamut is the antithesis of his sister [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Tiamat\|Tiamat]], as both of them represent opposing values, and this enmity is reflected in the attitude of each deity's worshipers as well.

#### Powers
Those that saw him fight claimed that he had two breath weapons, one a powerful Cone of Cold, the other a vapour which turns his enemies into a gaseous form. A special, third attack is his roar which is so powerful that it can disintegrate creatures or objects within 100ft. If facing off against particularly powerful opponents this roar could still permanently deafen those who weren't turned to dust. Further he is able to breathe holy winds, which allowed him to heal allies and even resurrect his fallen comrades. He is reputed to know every arcane and divine spell. Bahamut is able to see invisible beings and objects, and can breathe underwater indefinitely. Few things in the mortal world can cause him lasting harm. 

Despite this, Bahamut disdains true combat and prefers to talk with opponents and convince them to surrender using his legendary diplomatic skills. Bahamut speaks many languages, including Draconic, Celestial, Auran, and Common, though he has the ability to talk to any intelligent creature thanks to his ever-present, receptive form of telepathy. 

Whilst Bahamut is able to create Aspects of himself through the willing sacrifice of powerful metallic dragons, he prefers that his dragon worshippers remained dragons rather than sacrifice themselves. However sometimes he has asked a follower to become an aspect when it was needed; to become an emissary, a long-term guardian  or to hunt down evil beings too powerful for  mortal to face.

Occasionally, aspects of Bahamut arise spontaneously on Celestia or a closely related plane. Unlike Bahamut's normal aspects, these spontaneous aspects are short-lived, biological echoes of Bahamut's divine will. These aspects usually faded to nothingness within a day. These aspects were usually the ones who answered the magical summons of Bahamut's worshipers.

According to some sages, aspects of Bahamut physically combined elements of all kinds of metallic dragons, and were big enough to tower even the greatest of the mortal ancient dragons. Aspects of Bahamut were fearless, surprisingly intelligent combatants who cared nothing for their continued existence, something that made them far more dangerous than mortal dragons because of their coldly calculated rage and battle acumen. Aspects of Bahamut usually fought to the death unless their existence was more important than any tactical gain they could get from a battle. Despite this, aspects of Bahamut were more willing to converse with mortals and deal diplomatically with them than most divine aspects, though they only spoke from positions of superiority due to them as representatives of the Platinum Dragon.

#### Followers
The majority of Bahamut's worshipers prior to the Spellplague were metallic dragons. While he was revered by all good dragons, gold, silver, and brass dragons held him in particularly high regard.

Followers of Bahamut often take quests to oppose the schemes of Tiamat and to stop or destroy her followers. They were allies of worshipers of Torm, Moradin, Yondalla, and other lawful good deities.

Bahamut is unable to turn his back on any good creatures that are in need, even if Tiamat isn't involved. Even so, he prefers to help them in indirect ways, such as giving them useful information, needed advice that bordered on prophecy, a safe refuge or healing, and bolstering them with his powerful magic.

Bahamut accepts only clerics of good alignments. Whether they are dragons, dragonborn, half-dragons, or other beings attracted to his philosophy, clerics of the Platinum Dragon must always strive to take constant but subtle actions on behalf of good while trying to do as little harm in the process as possible.

#### Rites
Bahamut's worshipers and clergy have no formal rituals or ceremonies. Those who followed the Platinum Dragon believed in the philosophy of "praying through their deeds". The only activity that was considered as something like a ritual was the Rite of Rebirth, the magical process by which non-dragon humanoids transformed themselves into dragonborn.

#### Temple of Bahamut
![GL_SolarCathedral_GroundFloor_Original_Day.jpg|350](/img/user/zAttachments/GL_SolarCathedral_GroundFloor_Original_Day.jpg)
*(Image to evoke a feeling, not completely accurate to the real location)*

The Temple of [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]] is a large, bright space that purposefully lacks grandeur or colour schemes, with simple furnishings and elegant furniture.
The lack of colours, instead, draws the eye to the metallics in the room; Gold, Silver, Copper, Bronze, Steel and so on. In some areas of the temple, the metals mix to contrast one another, whereas in other areas they blend together. The use of these metals is done very sparingly so as to retain the feeling that the space is not adorned.

Unlike many of the other [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Draconic Temples]], the Temple of [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]] does not have a large, overbearing statue, instead a small alcove stores a 4ft tall [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]] figure. The figure is made of platinum, has a tail the same length as the body, and seems to glow with a feint blue aura. 

Despite the size of the temple, it is rare to find dragonkin worshipping within as followers of [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]] show their devotion to the Dragon God with their deeds rather than through ritual or ceremony. The one exception is the "Rite of Rebirth", a ritual which has never been performed on [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]], but which includes a magical process through which non-dragonborn humanoids transform themselves into [[zzRules/DnD Basic Rules (SRD)/04) Backlink Glossary/Species/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]].

Seven tiny gold dragons are claimed to be hidden around the temple chamber, watching over [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]]. The rumour is unclear if they are statuette's or real dragons.

# Tiamat
Tiamat is the dragon goddess of greed, and queen lawful evil dragons.

![Tiamat.png|350](/img/user/zzzAttachments/Tiamat.png)
**Symbol -** 5 dragon claws, each a colour matching one of Tiamat's heads. Sometimes 5 Draconic heads are used instead of claws.

#### Form
Tiamat is a unique, 5-headed chromatic dragon, with a head for each of the most common chromatic dragon colours (Black  Blue, Green, Red, White). Each head is able to operate independently of one another and had the powers of the respective race of dragonkind. Her body also has traits similar to that of a wyvern, with a long tail, tipped with a venomous stinger. 

Tiamat has three main avatars;

As *The Chromatic Dragon*, she has stubby legs and five heads, which could be any combination of colours belonging to a chromatic dragon. The skin of each head formed into three stripes- blue-green, grey, and purple, these stripes then merged again to form her brown skin which covered her tail.

*[[The World/People of the World/Avatars/The Dark Lady\|The Dark Lady]]*, a Mulan woman with long, dark hair and completely black eyes. She always wore robes and often had a seductive smile on her face. 

*The Undying Queen* is a dracolich version of her Chromatic Dragon form.
 
#### Alignment
Tiamat is arrogant, greedy, hateful, spiteful and vain. She never forgives any slight, and is always focussed on gaining more power and wealth. She disdains mortals, regarding them as mere disposable tools in her schemes. When needed she could be charming and fey, but her self-serving and reptilian nature betrays her sooner or later.

Tiamat enjoys the company of dragons, and has many great wyrm consorts of the chromatic varieties. 

She has an insatiable greed for treasures, but prefers that her followers bring them to her rather than searching for riches herself.

Tiamat keep an active watch over evil dragonkind and always stirs them to further actions of avarice, pride and wickedness.

Tiamat is the antithesis of her brother [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]], as both of them represent opposing values, and this enmity is reflected in the attitude of each deity's worshipers as well.

Tiamat also considers [[The World/Deities/Human Gods/Ilmatar\|Ilmatar]] among her list of enemies.

#### Powers
As a unique chromatic dragon with the traits of the five most common chromatic varieties, Tiamat is a foe to be reckoned with in battle.

Along with all the standard powers and godly senses of a deity of her rank, those who saw her fight claimed that her heads are able to cooperate in battle, and that those heads have the ability to use the breath weapons and spell-like abilities common to their species. Although her sheer size prevents claw and kick attacks while on the ground, she is adept at their use while flying. She also has a stinger on her tail that injects a powerful venom on her foes, killing them in agonizing pain.

#### Followers
Many evil dragons have worshipped Tiamat since their species first appeared on [[The World/The World Beyond Qba/Toril/Toril\|Toril]].  [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Kobolds of Q'ba\|Kobolds of Q'ba]] believed she was their creator, though they did not worship her as a god they revered her as their creator. Since the spellplague she has gained some [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] followers. 

The Church of Tiamat is regimented with a strict hierachy of ranks and titles. 

Tiamat only accepts evil clerics. They, like Tiamat herself, seek to place the world under the domination of evil dragons.

#### Rites
Whilst not explicitly rituals in themselves, her clerics are constantly occupied by the tasks of acquiring an ever increasing hoard of wealth for the faith, and sabotaging the faiths of other deities. As a result much of their time is spent with an unending series of thefts, assassinations, acts of vandalism, and arson.

#### Temple of Tiamat
Of all the temples in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]], the Temple of [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Tiamat\|Tiamat]] is the most completely destroyed. 

The temple was razed through [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/Newspaper Clippings/Temple of Tiamat Torched!\|fire and ransacking]], killing everyone inside.

Prior to this, the temple space was quite dark and bare, appearing more as a meeting place for illicit conversation away from prying ears than that of a holy prayer room.
