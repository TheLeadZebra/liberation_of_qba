Of all the temples in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]], the Temple of [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Tiamat\|Tiamat]] is the most completely destroyed. 

The temple was razed through [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/Newspaper Clippings/Temple of Tiamat Torched!\|fire and ransacking]], killing everyone inside.

Prior to this, the temple space was quite dark and bare, appearing more as a meeting place for illicit conversation away from prying ears than that of a holy prayer room.
