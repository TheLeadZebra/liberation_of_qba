*(Image to evoke a feeling, not completely accurate to the real location)*

The Temple of [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]] is a large, bright space that purposefully lacks grandeur or colour schemes, with simple furnishings and elegant furniture.
The lack of colours, instead, draws the eye to the metallics in the room; Gold, Silver, Copper, Bronze, Steel and so on. In some areas of the temple, the metals mix to contrast one another, whereas in other areas they blend together. The use of these metals is done very sparingly so as to retain the feeling that the space is not adorned.

Unlike many of the other [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Draconic Temples]], the Temple of [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]] does not have a large, overbearing statue, instead a small alcove stores a 4ft tall [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]] figure. The figure is made of platinum, has a tail the same length as the body, and seems to glow with a feint blue aura. 

Despite the size of the temple, it is rare to find dragonkin worshipping within as followers of [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]] show their devotion to the Dragon God with their deeds rather than through ritual or ceremony. The one exception is the "Rite of Rebirth", a ritual which has never been performed on [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]], but which includes a magical process through which non-dragonborn humanoids transform themselves into [[zzRules/DnD Basic Rules (SRD)/04) Backlink Glossary/Species/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]].

Seven tiny gold dragons are claimed to be hidden around the temple chamber, watching over [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]]. The rumour is unclear if they are statuette's or real dragons.
