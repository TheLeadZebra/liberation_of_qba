### Astilabor

![Astilabor Icon.webp|250](/img/user/zzzAttachments/Astilabor%20Icon.webp)

**Symbol** - A twelve-faceted Gem - seen upon a shield above.

*"May you find what you seek"*

Astilabor, one of [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods\|The Four Cardinal Gods]], is the Goddess of Acquisitiveness and Wealth. She represents the draconic desire to hoard acquired treasure and wealth, inclusive of knowledge. 

(In this campaign) Astilabor manifests herself as a topaz dragon, shimmering with a purple iridescence, and an underbelly of gold.

While not every follower of Astilabor is a devout spouter of scripture, many [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] engrave her symbol onto their hoard as a form of protective ward. Many who pray to Astilabor offer a share of their gains in return for good favour during their ventures, but never sacrificed what they owed. It was believed that Astilabor would lose respect for them should they give up their wealth so easily.

Her followers were generally mistrusting of followers of trickery and mischief, however Astilabor herself saw these as positive traits when used to take wealth from another, though she did not look kindly on the theft of wealth from her own followers.

Clerics of Astilabor tended to be neutral in alignment, as she had to be confident that they would stand fast in their pursuit of gaining knowledge and acquiring treasures.

Temples to Astilabor, such as the one in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm's]] [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]], are often grand and filled with lavish furnishings, and expensive treasures, such as platinum candleholders and sconces. Each treasure within the temple was always marked clearly with who the owner was, often marked using particular characteristics defining an individual, so as to prove the wealth still belonged to them.

Oftentimes Astilabor is mis-characterized as being a Goddess of Greed, however this is not the case and Astilabor disapproved of [[The World/Deities/The Binary Gods/The Binary Gods#Tiamat\|Tiamat's]] naked display of it. Astilabor, on rare occasions, gifted a boon from her personal hoard to those who had pleased her.

Astilabor rules over the region of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Astilabors Peak/Astilabors Peak\|Astilabors Peak]] on [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]], the land here is gifted with plentiful gems and precious minerals.

*(Image to evoke a feeling, not completely accurate to the real location)*

The Temple of Astilabor features a floor mural of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Astilabors Peak/Points of Interest/Astilabor's Peak Mountain\|Astilabor's Peak Mountain]], and a large statue of Astilabor stands at the far end of the chapel: A topaz dragon, shimmering with a purple iridescence and an underbelly of gold.

This temple retains the grandeur often found among Temples to Astilabor, it is expected to be filled with lavish furnishings, and expensive treasures, such as platinum candle holders and sconces. Each treasure within the temple was always marked clearly with who the owner was, often marked using particular characteristics defining an individual, so as to prove the wealth still belonged to them.

The temple also features a plentiful amount of bookcases filled with books of knowledge, each also featuring a unique marking or stamp defining who each belongs to. 

The temple was ransacked in recent times by humans, claiming that the draconic god encouraged greed and hoarding of wealth.

#### Astilabor's Clerical Domains

- Knowledge - The domain of Knowledge values learning and understanding above all. Astilabor teaches that knowledge is to be gathered and hoarded, only to be shared with friends or allies.
- Trickery - Gods of Trickery are michief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They are patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels and liberators, and their clerics are a disruptive force which punctures pride, mock tyrants, steal from the rich and free captives. Those followers of Trickery prefer subterfuge, pranks and deception to direct confrontation. 

### Garyx

![Garyx Icon.webp|250](/img/user/zzzAttachments/Garyx%20Icon.webp)
**Symbol** - A draconic eye, imposed over a red flame.

*"May the fires wash away your sins"*

Garyx, the chaotic God of Fire, Destruction and Renewal is one of [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods\|The Four Cardinal Gods]]. He is the patron of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]] and is responsible for the domains of Tempest and Light. A symbol of sheer power and destructive force, specifically of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonkind]], as well as the cleansing power of fire and flame, as well as lightning. Garyx manifests himself as a huge dragon of bold red, and bronze. 

Respected by both worshippers of destruction and of cleansing, often his followers believe that his fire can sterilise the world from evil, however Garyx often pays little attention to the wants of his followers, yet his Clerics do not worry about this. They believed that he grants them the power to perform acts of destruction, which was enough for them. 

Even on the island of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] Garyx has very few temples outside of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]] in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]], however his symbol will often be found carved beside his followers handiwork. On the otherhand, it was not uncommon for druids to revere Garyx, knowing that sometimes devestation was necessary for rejuvination.

#### The Temple of Garyx

![GL_BlueDragonLair_FireTemple.jpg|300](/img/user/zAttachments/GL_BlueDragonLair_FireTemple.jpg)
*(Image to evoke a feeling, not completely accurate to the real location)*


Prior to it's ironic destruction during a riot against "corrupt draconic gods", the temple of Garyx was a simple chamber set within a canyon created by a magically induced earthquake. At the end of the canyon was a huge firepit. Followers of Garyx would feed this neverending fire with scrolls denoting bad deeds, from which they believed the destruction of these scrolls cleansed them off their wrongdoings. 

Other items would also be fed to the flames, depending on a dragons own wants, needs for, or ideas about, cleansing, renewal or rebirth.

#### Garyx's Clerical Domain

- Light - The God of Light promotes the ideals of rebirth and renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty.
- Tempest - As a God of Tempest, Garyx presents as a god of fire, and of thunder and lightning. Known for swift justice applied to any who cross him, and his Clerics inspire folk, with displays of strength, to remain on the path of righteousness.

### Null

![Null Icon.webp|250](/img/user/zzzAttachments/Null%20Icon.webp)
**Symbol** - The skull of an ancient dragon

*"May Null watch over you, as you rest"*

Null is one of [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods\|The Four Cardinal Gods]]. He is the God of Death and of dead Dragons, as well as the God of undeath. Null holds dominion over [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Stillwater Mire/Stillwater Mire\|Stillwater Mire]] and holds the domains of Death and War. He is the Guardian of the Lost, who ferries the souls of the dead to their intended destinations, especially those who died in battle.

When manifesting himself, Null appears as an impenetrable region of blackness in the shape of a dragon, and his voice is said to be the dusty croak of undead. Legend says that to touch him is to instantly die.

Null is prideful and arrogant, fatalistic and utterly humorless. Though he is not easily angered, he holds grudges which may develop into undying hatred. 

He is worshiped by all [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] of any alignment. Whether a goodly dragon wishes to speed a lost loved one to the afterlife, or an evil one wanted to attack a city with an army of undead, a prayer was said to Null. 

Temples to Null - such as the one in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]] in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]] - often take the form of an underground cavern, cloaked in shadows and dimly lit. Dragons of all breeds and alignments tried to make their way here before they die, and their remains lay strew across the floor, including any treasures the dragons may have had with them or worn. The spirits of these Dragons stay to guard the temples from any who aim to steal from the burial pit. 

[[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods#Tamara\|Tamara]] is known to be resented by Null due to her interference with the inevitability of death.

#### The Temple of Null

![Pasted image 20251107170028.jpg|300](/img/user/zAttachments/Pasted%20image%2020251107170028.jpg)
*(Image to evoke a feeling, not completely accurate to the real location)*

The temple of Null is a unique building. Dead bodies lie neatly throughout the temple, the smell of decay soaked into every pore of stone, wood, or any other materials used in its construction. The main chambers of the temple are underground with no natural light, only dim candles light the spaces between corpses in which to move between. 

The far side of the chamber is slightly raised on a dais, here the shape of the draconic Null is formed from impenetrable blackness.

Followers of Null who are about to die, especially of draconic ancestry, find their way here in their final moments bringing with them any treasures or items they cannot bear to part with.

The temple of Null has been sealed to avoid the risk of the dead being disturbed by a potential ransacking as with many of the other [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]] temples in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]].

#### Null's Clerical Domain

- Death - The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures.
- War - Despite it's negative connotations, War can have many manifestations. It can make heroes of the ordinary, it may be desperate, horrific and cruel, or cowardly. It may also exist as a demonstration of justice, vengeance, excellence or courage. As the God of War, Null watches over great warriors and reward their deeds.

### Tamara

![Tamara Icon.webp|250](/img/user/zzzAttachments/Tamara%20Icon.webp)

**Symbol** - A seven-pointed star on a field of black.

*"May you bathe in her Mercy"*

Tamara is one of [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods\|The Four Cardinal Gods]], and the Goddess of life, mercy and forgiveness. Tamara ruled over the region of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall/Dimmafall\|Dimmafall]], and the domains of Life and Nature.

Tamara manifests herself as a wingless Green dragon with burnished edge scales. She radiates a comforting aura. Though the kindest and most benevolent of the draconic deities, it is not a trait which should be mistaken for weakness, those that do often regret making the error. 

Mostly worshipped by [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] aligned with the poison element, as well as many neutral good dragons of other colour, Tamara's faith had a reputation of being peaceful and merciful, however her followers did not hesitate to stand against evil or tyranny if they needed to.

Many of Tamara's clerics are healers, but also deliverers of death to those who tried to escape it. They seek to destroy undead across the lands, in particular draconic undead. Her temples were often also hospitals or places of healing where the ill or injured were welcomes. Terminally ill [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] are cared for with dignity and respect and when dragons died in her temple their passing is greeted with a positive light, as a merciful way to escape the hardships of life.

#### The Temple of Tamara

![GL_GrandCathedralInterior_Original_Day.jpg|400](/img/user/zAttachments/GL_GrandCathedralInterior_Original_Day.jpg)
*(Image to evoke a feeling, not completely accurate to the real location)*

The Temple of Tamara is a place of worship to Tamara, one of [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods\|The Four Cardinal Gods]] of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]]. The temple sits in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]] and is the eastern temple in the cardinal sector. 

Tamara is the god of Life, Mercy, and Forgiveness and this motif fills the large open space. The hall is flooded with coloured light from stained windows dozens of feet overhead, each vibrantly depicting scenes of bardic heroes, children playing, people signing treaties, and generally imagery of nature, including a [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall/Points of Interest/The Arcadian Torrent\|waterfall which appears to flow from the heavens themselves]].

Rows of pews face towards a towering statue depicting Tamara, a wingless green dragon whose scales have burnished edges, whose presence emits a comforting aura. A large section of carpet before the statue depicts Tamara's seven-pointed star.

Most of those who can be found worshiping here are likely to be good aligned, though draconic druids of any alignment may find themselves here whilst visiting the city on other business.

#### Tamara's Clerical Domain

- Life - The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy which sustains all life. the God of Life promotes vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring from those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Tamara too values the draconic element of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Poison]], with an understanding that all which heals may also kill in the incorrect dosage.
- Nature - Gods of nature are varied, but Tamara presents herself as a kind God of the forest, who inspires her followers to keep [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall/Dimmafall\|Dimmafall]] free of corruption and monstrosities.
