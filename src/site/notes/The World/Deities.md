A Deity is a god, a mighty being who can weave the fabric of space, time, or perhaps even both.


# The Four Cardinal Gods

The Four Cardinal Gods are each of the primary gods of the island, with each having their own domains and associated regions on the island. Each of [[The World/Deities#The Four Cardinal Gods\|The Four Cardinal Gods]] have divided the 8 standard Clerical domains between them, each residing over 2. 



### Astilabor

![Astilabor Icon.webp|250](/img/user/zzzAttachments/Astilabor%20Icon.webp)

**Symbol** - A twelve-faceted Gem - seen upon a shield above.

*"May you find what you seek"*

Astilabor, one of [[The World/Deities#The Four Cardinal Gods\|The Four Cardinal Gods]], is the Goddess of Acquisitiveness and Wealth. She represents the draconic desire to hoard acquired treasure and wealth, inclusive of knowledge. 

(In this campaign) Astilabor manifests herself as a topaz dragon, shimmering with a purple iridescence, and an underbelly of gold.

While not every follower of Astilabor is a devout spouter of scripture, many [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] engrave her symbol onto their hoard as a form of protective ward. Many who pray to Astilabor offer a share of their gains in return for good favour during their ventures, but never sacrificed what they owed. It was believed that Astilabor would lose respect for them should they give up their wealth so easily.

Her followers were generally mistrusting of followers of trickery and mischief, however Astilabor herself saw these as positive traits when used to take wealth from another, though she did not look kindly on the theft of wealth from her own followers.

Clerics of Astilabor tended to be neutral in alignment, as she had to be confident that they would stand fast in their pursuit of gaining knowledge and acquiring treasures.

Temples to Astilabor, such as the one in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm's]] [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]], are often grand and filled with lavish furnishings, and expensive treasures, such as platinum candleholders and sconces. Each treasure within the temple was always marked clearly with who the owner was, often marked using particular characteristics defining an individual, so as to prove the wealth still belonged to them.

Oftentimes Astilabor is mis-characterized as being a Goddess of Greed, however this is not the case and Astilabor disapproved of [[The World/Deities#Tiamat\|Tiamat's]] naked display of it. Astilabor, on rare occasions, gifted a boon from her personal hoard to those who had pleased her.

Astilabor rules over the region of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Astilabors Peak/Astilabors Peak\|Astilabors Peak]] on [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]], the land here is gifted with plentiful gems and precious minerals.

#### The Temple of Astilabor

![Pasted image 20251107123421.jpg|300](/img/user/zAttachments/Pasted%20image%2020251107123421.jpg)
*(Image to evoke a feeling, not completely accurate to the real location)*

The Temple of Astilabor features a floor mural of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Astilabors Peak/Points of Interest/Astilabor's Peak Mountain\|Astilabor's Peak Mountain]], and a large statue of Astilabor stands at the far end of the chapel: A topaz dragon, shimmering with a purple iridescence and an underbelly of gold.

This temple retains the grandeur often found among Temples to Astilabor, it is expected to be filled with lavish furnishings, and expensive treasures, such as platinum candle holders and sconces. Each treasure within the temple was always marked clearly with who the owner was, often marked using particular characteristics defining an individual, so as to prove the wealth still belonged to them.

The temple also features a plentiful amount of bookcases filled with books of knowledge, each also featuring a unique marking or stamp defining who each belongs to. 

The temple was ransacked in recent times by humans, claiming that the draconic god encouraged greed and hoarding of wealth.

#### Astilabor's Clerical Domains

- Knowledge - The domain of Knowledge values learning and understanding above all. Astilabor teaches that knowledge is to be gathered and hoarded, only to be shared with friends or allies.
- Trickery - Gods of Trickery are michief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They are patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels and liberators, and their clerics are a disruptive force which punctures pride, mock tyrants, steal from the rich and free captives. Those followers of Trickery prefer subterfuge, pranks and deception to direct confrontation. 

### Garyx

![Garyx Icon.webp|250](/img/user/zzzAttachments/Garyx%20Icon.webp)
**Symbol** - A draconic eye, imposed over a red flame.

*"May the fires wash away your sins"*

Garyx, the chaotic God of Fire, Destruction and Renewal is one of [[The World/Deities#The Four Cardinal Gods\|The Four Cardinal Gods]]. He is the patron of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]] and is responsible for the domains of Tempest and Light. A symbol of sheer power and destructive force, specifically of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonkind]], as well as the cleansing power of fire and flame, as well as lightning. Garyx manifests himself as a huge dragon of bold red, and bronze. 

Respected by both worshippers of destruction and of cleansing, often his followers believe that his fire can sterilise the world from evil, however Garyx often pays little attention to the wants of his followers, yet his Clerics do not worry about this. They believed that he grants them the power to perform acts of destruction, which was enough for them. 

Even on the island of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] Garyx has very few temples outside of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]] in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]], however his symbol will often be found carved beside his followers handiwork. On the otherhand, it was not uncommon for druids to revere Garyx, knowing that sometimes devestation was necessary for rejuvination.

#### The Temple of Garyx

![GL_BlueDragonLair_FireTemple.jpg|300](/img/user/zAttachments/GL_BlueDragonLair_FireTemple.jpg)
*(Image to evoke a feeling, not completely accurate to the real location)*


Prior to it's ironic destruction during a riot against "corrupt draconic gods", the temple of Garyx was a simple chamber set within a canyon created by a magically induced earthquake. At the end of the canyon was a huge firepit. Followers of Garyx would feed this neverending fire with scrolls denoting bad deeds, from which they believed the destruction of these scrolls cleansed them off their wrongdoings. 

Other items would also be fed to the flames, depending on a dragons own wants, needs for, or ideas about, cleansing, renewal or rebirth.

#### Garyx's Clerical Domain

- Light - The God of Light promotes the ideals of rebirth and renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty.
- Tempest - As a God of Tempest, Garyx presents as a god of fire, and of thunder and lightning. Known for swift justice applied to any who cross him, and his Clerics inspire folk, with displays of strength, to remain on the path of righteousness.

### Null

![Null Icon.webp|250](/img/user/zzzAttachments/Null%20Icon.webp)
**Symbol** - The skull of an ancient dragon

*"May Null watch over you, as you rest"*

Null is one of [[The World/Deities#The Four Cardinal Gods\|The Four Cardinal Gods]]. He is the God of Death and of dead Dragons, as well as the God of undeath. Null holds dominion over [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Stillwater Mire/Stillwater Mire\|Stillwater Mire]] and holds the domains of Death and War. He is the Guardian of the Lost, who ferries the souls of the dead to their intended destinations, especially those who died in battle.

When manifesting himself, Null appears as an impenetrable region of blackness in the shape of a dragon, and his voice is said to be the dusty croak of undead. Legend says that to touch him is to instantly die.

Null is prideful and arrogant, fatalistic and utterly humorless. Though he is not easily angered, he holds grudges which may develop into undying hatred. 

He is worshiped by all [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] of any alignment. Whether a goodly dragon wishes to speed a lost loved one to the afterlife, or an evil one wanted to attack a city with an army of undead, a prayer was said to Null. 

Temples to Null - such as the one in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]] in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]] - often take the form of an underground cavern, cloaked in shadows and dimly lit. Dragons of all breeds and alignments tried to make their way here before they die, and their remains lay strew across the floor, including any treasures the dragons may have had with them or worn. The spirits of these Dragons stay to guard the temples from any who aim to steal from the burial pit. 

[[The World/Deities#Tamara\|Tamara]] is known to be resented by Null due to her interference with the inevitability of death.

#### The Temple of Null

![Pasted image 20251107170028.jpg|300](/img/user/zAttachments/Pasted%20image%2020251107170028.jpg)
*(Image to evoke a feeling, not completely accurate to the real location)*

The temple of Null is a unique building. Dead bodies lie neatly throughout the temple, the smell of decay soaked into every pore of stone, wood, or any other materials used in its construction. The main chambers of the temple are underground with no natural light, only dim candles light the spaces between corpses in which to move between. 

The far side of the chamber is slightly raised on a dais, here the shape of the draconic Null is formed from impenetrable blackness.

Followers of Null who are about to die, especially of draconic ancestry, find their way here in their final moments bringing with them any treasures or items they cannot bear to part with.

The temple of Null has been sealed to avoid the risk of the dead being disturbed by a potential ransacking as with many of the other [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]] temples in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]].

#### Null's Clerical Domain

- Death - The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures.
- War - Despite it's negative connotations, War can have many manifestations. It can make heroes of the ordinary, it may be desperate, horrific and cruel, or cowardly. It may also exist as a demonstration of justice, vengeance, excellence or courage. As the God of War, Null watches over great warriors and reward their deeds.

### Tamara

![Tamara Icon.webp|250](/img/user/zzzAttachments/Tamara%20Icon.webp)

**Symbol** - A seven-pointed star on a field of black.

*"May you bathe in her Mercy"*

Tamara is one of [[The World/Deities#The Four Cardinal Gods\|The Four Cardinal Gods]], and the Goddess of life, mercy and forgiveness. Tamara ruled over the region of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall/Dimmafall\|Dimmafall]], and the domains of Life and Nature.

Tamara manifests herself as a wingless Green dragon with burnished edge scales. She radiates a comforting aura. Though the kindest and most benevolent of the draconic deities, it is not a trait which should be mistaken for weakness, those that do often regret making the error. 

Mostly worshipped by [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] aligned with the poison element, as well as many neutral good dragons of other colour, Tamara's faith had a reputation of being peaceful and merciful, however her followers did not hesitate to stand against evil or tyranny if they needed to.

Many of Tamara's clerics are healers, but also deliverers of death to those who tried to escape it. They seek to destroy undead across the lands, in particular draconic undead. Her temples were often also hospitals or places of healing where the ill or injured were welcomes. Terminally ill [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] are cared for with dignity and respect and when dragons died in her temple their passing is greeted with a positive light, as a merciful way to escape the hardships of life.

#### The Temple of Tamara

![GL_GrandCathedralInterior_Original_Day.jpg|400](/img/user/zAttachments/GL_GrandCathedralInterior_Original_Day.jpg)
*(Image to evoke a feeling, not completely accurate to the real location)*

The Temple of Tamara is a place of worship to Tamara, one of [[The World/Deities#The Four Cardinal Gods\|The Four Cardinal Gods]] of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]]. The temple sits in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]] and is the eastern temple in the cardinal sector. 

Tamara is the god of Life, Mercy, and Forgiveness and this motif fills the large open space. The hall is flooded with coloured light from stained windows dozens of feet overhead, each vibrantly depicting scenes of bardic heroes, children playing, people signing treaties, and generally imagery of nature, including a [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall/Points of Interest/The Arcadian Torrent\|waterfall which appears to flow from the heavens themselves]].

Rows of pews face towards a towering statue depicting Tamara, a wingless green dragon whose scales have burnished edges, whose presence emits a comforting aura. A large section of carpet before the statue depicts Tamara's seven-pointed star.

Most of those who can be found worshiping here are likely to be good aligned, though draconic druids of any alignment may find themselves here whilst visiting the city on other business.

#### Tamara's Clerical Domain

- Life - The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy which sustains all life. the God of Life promotes vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring from those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Tamara too values the draconic element of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Poison]], with an understanding that all which heals may also kill in the incorrect dosage.
- Nature - Gods of nature are varied, but Tamara presents herself as a kind God of the forest, who inspires her followers to keep [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall/Dimmafall\|Dimmafall]] free of corruption and monstrosities.

# The Binary Gods

The Binary Gods are [[The World/Deities#Bahamut\|Bahamut]] and [[The World/Deities#Tiamat\|Tiamat]], who brought their presence to the island of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] after a [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/Civil War\|Civil War]] within the city of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]]. 

Though they are more powerful than any of [[The World/Deities#The Four Cardinal Gods\|The Four Cardinal Gods]] individually, their hold on the island is far less impressive, with much of their focus elsewhere. This however, does not mean those who worship the Binary Gods are small in number, as many on the island recognise the gods of the island as a whole rather than the smaller number who choose a favoured Deity and dedicate themselves wholly towards them. 

The Binary Gods each have their own temple within the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]], as with the other gods of the island.


### Bahamut
Bahamut is the dragon god of enlightened justice (justice tempered with mercy and punishment with forgiveness) and lawful good dragons. 

![Bahamut Icon.jpg|350](/img/user/zzzAttachments/Bahamut%20Icon.jpg)
**Symbol** - A platinum dragon profiled against a blue background.
#### Form
His natural form is that of a platinum metallic dragon, approximately 180ft (55ft) in total length, with a tail the same length as his body, said by many to be the only one of his kind. His scales are said to be tougher than any shield (some say nearly indestructible) and glow with a feint blue sheen. He also has blue eyes, the exact shade of which shifts depending on Bahamut's mood. Bahamut has been known to wonder the mortal world, taking the appearance of an old human or a demihuman wizard dressed as a peasant accompanied by songbirds. This persona became known among mortals as [[The World/People of the World/Avatars/Fizban the Fabulous\|Fizban the Fabulous]], whom sages believed was designed so as to not frighten non-dragon beings. The sages also believe that he has many other guises as well.

He is the eternal rival of his sister, [[The World/Deities#Tiamat\|Tiamat]], queen of the chromatic dragons. 

#### Alignmentment
Bahamut is stern and very disapproving of evil, he accepts no excuses for evil acts, and doesn't tolerate even minor offenses by evil creatures. Yet in spite of this stance, he is also considered one of the most compassionate beings in the multiverse. He has limitless empathy for the downtrodden, the dispossessed and the helpless. He usually preferred to polymorph those who had offended him rather than killing them, Bahamut loathed to sully himself with the blood of even evil creatures. 

By draconic standards, Bahamut is neither vain nor desirous of treasure. Instead he values wisdom, knowledge, prophecies, and songs instead. He uses the great wealth he has amassed over the ages in order to help those in need, using the magic items he has gathered to further his goals.

Bahamut also likes to prove the strength and worthiness of his followers by battling them whilst in his dragon form, halting the combat when his followers are injured or overcame him. However he was known to get carried away by his zeal, and had powerful healers on hand in case he gravely injured one of his followers in those battles. 

Bahamut is the antithesis of his sister [[The World/Deities#Tiamat\|Tiamat]], as both of them represent opposing values, and this enmity is reflected in the attitude of each deity's worshipers as well.

#### Powers
Those that saw him fight claimed that he had two breath weapons, one a powerful Cone of Cold, the other a vapour which turns his enemies into a gaseous form. A special, third attack is his roar which is so powerful that it can disintegrate creatures or objects within 100ft. If facing off against particularly powerful opponents this roar could still permanently deafen those who weren't turned to dust. Further he is able to breathe holy winds, which allowed him to heal allies and even resurrect his fallen comrades. He is reputed to know every arcane and divine spell. Bahamut is able to see invisible beings and objects, and can breathe underwater indefinitely. Few things in the mortal world can cause him lasting harm. 

Despite this, Bahamut disdains true combat and prefers to talk with opponents and convince them to surrender using his legendary diplomatic skills. Bahamut speaks many languages, including Draconic, Celestial, Auran, and Common, though he has the ability to talk to any intelligent creature thanks to his ever-present, receptive form of telepathy. 

Whilst Bahamut is able to create Aspects of himself through the willing sacrifice of powerful metallic dragons, he prefers that his dragon worshippers remained dragons rather than sacrifice themselves. However sometimes he has asked a follower to become an aspect when it was needed; to become an emissary, a long-term guardian  or to hunt down evil beings too powerful for  mortal to face.

Occasionally, aspects of Bahamut arise spontaneously on Celestia or a closely related plane. Unlike Bahamut's normal aspects, these spontaneous aspects are short-lived, biological echoes of Bahamut's divine will. These aspects usually faded to nothingness within a day. These aspects were usually the ones who answered the magical summons of Bahamut's worshipers.

According to some sages, aspects of Bahamut physically combined elements of all kinds of metallic dragons, and were big enough to tower even the greatest of the mortal ancient dragons. Aspects of Bahamut were fearless, surprisingly intelligent combatants who cared nothing for their continued existence, something that made them far more dangerous than mortal dragons because of their coldly calculated rage and battle acumen. Aspects of Bahamut usually fought to the death unless their existence was more important than any tactical gain they could get from a battle. Despite this, aspects of Bahamut were more willing to converse with mortals and deal diplomatically with them than most divine aspects, though they only spoke from positions of superiority due to them as representatives of the Platinum Dragon.

#### Followers
The majority of Bahamut's worshipers prior to the Spellplague were metallic dragons. While he was revered by all good dragons, gold, silver, and brass dragons held him in particularly high regard.

Followers of Bahamut often take quests to oppose the schemes of Tiamat and to stop or destroy her followers. They were allies of worshipers of Torm, Moradin, Yondalla, and other lawful good deities.

Bahamut is unable to turn his back on any good creatures that are in need, even if Tiamat isn't involved. Even so, he prefers to help them in indirect ways, such as giving them useful information, needed advice that bordered on prophecy, a safe refuge or healing, and bolstering them with his powerful magic.

Bahamut accepts only clerics of good alignments. Whether they are dragons, dragonborn, half-dragons, or other beings attracted to his philosophy, clerics of the Platinum Dragon must always strive to take constant but subtle actions on behalf of good while trying to do as little harm in the process as possible.

#### Rites
Bahamut's worshipers and clergy have no formal rituals or ceremonies. Those who followed the Platinum Dragon believed in the philosophy of "praying through their deeds". The only activity that was considered as something like a ritual was the Rite of Rebirth, the magical process by which non-dragon humanoids transformed themselves into dragonborn.

#### Temple of Bahamut
![GL_SolarCathedral_GroundFloor_Original_Day.jpg|350](/img/user/zAttachments/GL_SolarCathedral_GroundFloor_Original_Day.jpg)
*(Image to evoke a feeling, not completely accurate to the real location)*

The Temple of [[The World/Deities#Bahamut\|Bahamut]] is a large, bright space that purposefully lacks grandeur or colour schemes, with simple furnishings and elegant furniture.
The lack of colours, instead, draws the eye to the metallics in the room; Gold, Silver, Copper, Bronze, Steel and so on. In some areas of the temple, the metals mix to contrast one another, whereas in other areas they blend together. The use of these metals is done very sparingly so as to retain the feeling that the space is not adorned.

Unlike many of the other [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Draconic Temples]], the Temple of [[The World/Deities#Bahamut\|Bahamut]] does not have a large, overbearing statue, instead a small alcove stores a 4ft tall [[The World/Deities#Bahamut\|Bahamut]] figure. The figure is made of platinum, has a tail the same length as the body, and seems to glow with a feint blue aura. 

Despite the size of the temple, it is rare to find dragonkin worshipping within as followers of [[The World/Deities#Bahamut\|Bahamut]] show their devotion to the Dragon God with their deeds rather than through ritual or ceremony. The one exception is the "Rite of Rebirth", a ritual which has never been performed on [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]], but which includes a magical process through which non-dragonborn humanoids transform themselves into [[zzRules/DnD Basic Rules (SRD)/04) Backlink Glossary/Species/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]].

Seven tiny gold dragons are claimed to be hidden around the temple chamber, watching over [[The World/Deities#Bahamut\|Bahamut]]. The rumour is unclear if they are statuette's or real dragons.

# Tiamat
Tiamat is the dragon goddess of greed, and queen lawful evil dragons.

![Tiamat.png|350](/img/user/zzzAttachments/Tiamat.png)
**Symbol -** 5 dragon claws, each a colour matching one of Tiamat's heads. Sometimes 5 Draconic heads are used instead of claws.

#### Form
Tiamat is a unique, 5-headed chromatic dragon, with a head for each of the most common chromatic dragon colours (Black  Blue, Green, Red, White). Each head is able to operate independently of one another and had the powers of the respective race of dragonkind. Her body also has traits similar to that of a wyvern, with a long tail, tipped with a venomous stinger. 

Tiamat has three main avatars;

As *The Chromatic Dragon*, she has stubby legs and five heads, which could be any combination of colours belonging to a chromatic dragon. The skin of each head formed into three stripes- blue-green, grey, and purple, these stripes then merged again to form her brown skin which covered her tail.

*[[The World/People of the World/Avatars/The Dark Lady\|The Dark Lady]]*, a Mulan woman with long, dark hair and completely black eyes. She always wore robes and often had a seductive smile on her face. 

*The Undying Queen* is a dracolich version of her Chromatic Dragon form.
 
#### Alignment
Tiamat is arrogant, greedy, hateful, spiteful and vain. She never forgives any slight, and is always focussed on gaining more power and wealth. She disdains mortals, regarding them as mere disposable tools in her schemes. When needed she could be charming and fey, but her self-serving and reptilian nature betrays her sooner or later.

Tiamat enjoys the company of dragons, and has many great wyrm consorts of the chromatic varieties. 

She has an insatiable greed for treasures, but prefers that her followers bring them to her rather than searching for riches herself.

Tiamat keep an active watch over evil dragonkind and always stirs them to further actions of avarice, pride and wickedness.

Tiamat is the antithesis of her brother [[The World/Deities#Bahamut\|Bahamut]], as both of them represent opposing values, and this enmity is reflected in the attitude of each deity's worshipers as well.

Tiamat also considers [[The World/Deities#Ilmater\|Ilmater]] among her list of enemies.

#### Powers
As a unique chromatic dragon with the traits of the five most common chromatic varieties, Tiamat is a foe to be reckoned with in battle.

Along with all the standard powers and godly senses of a deity of her rank, those who saw her fight claimed that her heads are able to cooperate in battle, and that those heads have the ability to use the breath weapons and spell-like abilities common to their species. Although her sheer size prevents claw and kick attacks while on the ground, she is adept at their use while flying. She also has a stinger on her tail that injects a powerful venom on her foes, killing them in agonizing pain.

#### Followers
Many evil dragons have worshipped Tiamat since their species first appeared on [[The World/The World Beyond Qba/Toril/Toril\|Toril]].  [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Kobolds of Q'ba\|Kobolds of Q'ba]] believed she was their creator, though they did not worship her as a god they revered her as their creator. Since the spellplague she has gained some [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] followers. 

The Church of Tiamat is regimented with a strict hierarchy of ranks and titles. 

Tiamat only accepts evil clerics. They, like Tiamat herself, seek to place the world under the domination of evil dragons.

#### Rites
Whilst not explicitly rituals in themselves, her clerics are constantly occupied by the tasks of acquiring an ever increasing hoard of wealth for the faith, and sabotaging the faiths of other deities. As a result much of their time is spent with an unending series of thefts, assassinations, acts of vandalism, and arson.

#### Temple of Tiamat
Of all the temples in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]], the Temple of [[The World/Deities#Tiamat\|Tiamat]] is the most completely destroyed. 

The temple was razed through [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/Newspaper Clippings/Temple of Tiamat Torched!\|fire and ransacking]], killing everyone inside.

Prior to this, the temple space was quite dark and bare, appearing more as a meeting place for illicit conversation away from prying ears than that of a holy prayer room. 

# The Human Gods

### Ilmater

Ilmater is the name of the [[The World/Deities\|Deity]] brought to the island by the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Humans/Humans of Q'ba\|Humans]] upon their arrival to [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]].

![Ilmater Icon.webp|350](/img/user/zzzAttachments/Ilmater%20Icon.webp)
**Symbol** - A pair of white, human hands, bound with a red cord.

Ilmater has many names:
- The Crying God
- The Broken God
- The Lord on the Rack
- The One Who Endures
- Our Martyred Father

He is the God of the suffering, the oppressed and the persecuted. He encourages them to endure, and encourages others to help them by taking their burdens or their place. Ilmater is a willinng sufferer, bearing the pain of others so that they may be spared from it, and it is said that if he had his way he would do it for all the sufferinng in the world.

In his Avatar form, Ilmater appears as a short human man with a burly build wearing only a breechcloth. He has a plain but kind and comforting face, a balding head and a hairy body. His body bears the marks of mutilation and torture on the rack, covered with open cuts, closed scars, burns and a range of other wounds. Ilmater's joints are broken, his limbs ravaged and his hands smashed, yet somehow still functional. Moving, alone, causes his a great deal of pain as he drags himself around. No matter how much his Avatar heals, it always shows these terrible wounds.

Ilmater is the incarnation of compassion, and the eternal foe of suffering. A generous, good spirited and even-tempered deity, with a king and gentle nature. He seeks to offer aid and relief and words of comfort to those in pain, who were oppressed or otherwise in great need. 

Ilmater does not anger quickly, but when he does he is fearsome in his wrath. He is greatly angered by extreme cruelty and atrocities and by those who inflicted such suffering. Particularly, his rage is great for those who harm or abuse children and other young creatures. He treasured all children and young creatures in general. Yet, Ilmater is the most forgiving of beings if they repent of their cruel deeds, hoping that all evil beings could one day be turned to good, or else destroyed. He is known for a rather rustic sense of humor and likes to hear funny stories.

The humans of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] follow Ilmater, relieving the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] of their oppression by allowing them to serve as aids, or workers to [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Humans/Humans of Q'ba\|Humans of Q'ba]] households or workforces - their labour in return for repayment of debts owed to [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]], or other figures. Of course they were willing to allow any [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Non-Human/Non-Human\|Non-Human]] this same favour, encouraging them to show their appreciation to Ilmater by pushing themselves beyond their body's limitations, as Ilmater himself would.

The temple of [[The World/Deities#Ilmater\|Ilmater]] in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Free Borough\|Free Borough]], named The Church of Saint Francis, looks like a large manor house surrounded by protective walls. 

The fairly undecorated and simple interior contains a few rooms, such as a chapel, a chapter house, a small library and an area for treating a few sick or injured people.

The manor grounds also include a stable, garden and a quarters for monks that tend the grounds.

The gardens grow an abundance of Daffodils, the flower is also the symbol of the church.
