On the Island of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]] live [[The World/Island Races/Non-Human/Dwarf\|The World/Island Races/Non-Human/Dwarf]], these are one of the species of [[The World/Island Races/Non-Human/Non-Humans\|Non-Humans]] that exist on the island. Bold and Hardy, Dwarves are known for being great as warriors and very skilled miners and excellent crafters of metal and stone. Though they are on the shorter side, their broadness and density often makes them equal that of [[The World/Island Races/Human/Human\|Humans]] in weight, despite often standing 2 feet shorter. On top of this their courage and endurance also easily match that of any of the larger folk.

Dwarves can commonly live to reach 400 years old, older dwarves can remember a world far different, however many of the Dwarves that have come to [[The World/The Island of Qba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]] are recent arrivals, with none having joined the island longer than 200 years ago. Though in this time they have outlived generations of [[The World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn\|The World/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn]], giving them a far greater perspective on the world at large, despite rarely leaving the region around [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Astilabors Peak/Astilabors Peak\|Astilabors Peak]].

The Dwarves that have chosen to call the island home are Mountain Dwarves, these Dwarves are certainly known to be strong and hardy, they are accustomed to life in rugged terrain. For a Dwarf, they are on the taller side and have a lighter colouration than their Hill dwelling counterparts. 

Though Dwarves are known for their hatred of [[The World/Island Races/Non-Human/Goblin\|Goblins]], here on [[The World/The Island of Qba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]] it seems they have found a way to co-exist and regularly benefit from greater riches being pulled from the earth through collaboration.
