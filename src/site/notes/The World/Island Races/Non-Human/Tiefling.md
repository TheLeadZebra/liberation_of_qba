Tieflings are [[The World/Island Races/Human/Human\|The World/Island Races/Human/Human]]-based Planetouched. Infused with the touch of the fiendish planes, most often through descent from fiends - Demons, Yugoloths, devils, evil deities and others, who have bred with [[The World/Island Races/Human/Human\|humans]]. A Tieflings lineage may have slept dormant for many generations before revealing itself once again in a new-born.

Tieflings are known for their cunning and personal allure, making them excellent decievers as well as inspiring leaders if prejudices are laid aside. Although their evil ancestors could be many generations removed, their taint lingers. Unlike a half-fiend, Tieflings are not predisposed to evil alignments and varied in alignments almost as much as full [[The World/Island Races/Human/Human\|humans]]. 

Tieflings tend to have an unsettling air about them, and most people have a feeling of discomfort around them whether they are aware of their ancestry or not. While some look indistinguishable to a normal [[The World/Island Races/Human/Human\|human]], many retain physical characteristics derived from their ancestor with the most common features being horns, tails and pointed teeth. Some Tieflings also have eyes that are solid orbs of black, red, white, silver or gold, whilst others have eyes more similar to a [[The World/Island Races/Human/Human\|The World/Island Races/Human/Human]]. Other, more unusual characteristics include: Sullphurous odour, cloven feet, or a general aura of discomfort that they leave on other things.

In many other ways, tieflings are similar to [[The World/Island Races/Human/Human\|humans]] physically. Tieflings are, on average, just as tall as umans and weigh just a little bit heavier. Often Tiefling skin is human-like in colour but may extend past human colours into reddish hues as well. Their hair, also is often the same colour as [[The World/Island Races/Human/Human\|human]] hair, though dark blue, red or purple are also common shades among the race. Though not always the case, Tieflings tended to have better reflexes than their [[The World/Island Races/Human/Human\|human]] kin. This, combined with their propensity for hiding and deceit, has given Tieflings a reputation for thievery and duplicity.

Tieflings born with strikingly inhuman features are often killed at birth, either by their parents or others that are horrified by their existance. Therefore, only those tieflings with subtle features, or born to someone indifferent of their appearence, either from acceptance or cruel purpose, are likely to reach adulthood. Those who do reach adulthood are expected to age at roughly the same rate as a [[The World/Island Races/Human/Human\|human]], though they have a lifespan around 20-40 years longer.

Most Tieflings are aware from a young age that they are different from others around them, and would often give in to strange urges and desires because of their unusual ancestry. Few Tieflings are raised with the love a normal child may expect, shaping many into bitter individuals who expect eventual rejection from all that they meet. Whilst this means that many follow this path into evil, other reject it wholeheartedly and seek to make a good impact on the world around them, often to the pointl of becoming some of the most heroic characters of all. Though these extremes are not uncommon, most Tieflings fall somewhere inbetween.

A Tieflings celestial counterpart is an Aasimar.
