Anodising titanium is a highly skilled art, on [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] which can only be performed by [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Electric Dragonborn]].

In order for titanium to be anodised, a layer of oxidation must be formed on the surface. The thickness of this oxidation determines the perceived colour of the metal, as the reflected light of the oxidised layer and titanium surface interfere with one another. 

For titanium anodising to work, very high voltages are required in order to create the required thickness of the oxidised layer, a copper colour requires the lowest thickness, with green being the highest. The size of an object determines how long the voltage must be applied for. Due to the optical property requirements, not every colour is possible, for example red. 

Only incredibly skilled and powerful [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn]] are able to perform such incredible feats.

One such example of this feat is the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Points of Interest/Statue of Greenscale\|Statue of Greenscale]], which resides in the centre of the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Beggars Gate\|Beggars Gate]] plaza, crafted by renowned artisan [[The World/Legendary Figures/Artisans/Stor Ondun\|Stor Ondun]].
