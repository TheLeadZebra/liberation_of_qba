### Q'ban Anodised Titanium
Anodising titanium is a highly skilled art, on [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] which can only be performed by [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Electric Dragonborn]].

In order for titanium to be anodised, a layer of oxidation must be formed on the surface. The thickness of this oxidation determines the perceived colour of the metal, as the reflected light of the oxidised layer and titanium surface interfere with one another. 

For titanium anodising to work, very high voltages are required in order to create the required thickness of the oxidised layer, a copper colour requires the lowest thickness, with green being the highest. The size of an object determines how long the voltage must be applied for. Due to the optical property requirements, not every colour is possible, for example red. 

Only incredibly skilled and powerful [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn]] are able to perform such incredible feats.

One such example of this feat is the [[Statue of Greenscale\|Statue of Greenscale]], which resides in the centre of the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#Beggar's Gate\|Beggar's Gate]] plaza, crafted by renowned artisan [[The World/People of the World/Artisans/Stor Ondun\|Stor Ondun]].

### Q'ban Dragon Glass
Dragon Glass is a unique material, known to be produced only on [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]]. High-quality, but very standard glass is magically infused with soot and charcoal from [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#The Bread Forge\|The Bread Forge]] district. Acting in-essence as one-way glass, from one side the glass appears tinted with various greys or blacks, but from the other the glass is perfectly transparent, allowing light to pass through.

In order to produce this form of glassmaking art, rare and a expensive gems are required which makes these types of windows extremely expensive and sought after. The large quantity of gems harvested from the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Astilabors Peak/Astilabors Peak\|Astilabors Peak]] is the main reason that this kind of glass can be produced on the island, combined with the skilful use of a Dragonborn's Breath.
