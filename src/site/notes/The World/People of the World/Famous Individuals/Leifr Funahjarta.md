Leifr Funahjarta, son of [[The World/People of the World/Rulers/Emperor Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Emperor Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta]], is also a [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Golden Dragonborn]] and thus is of an ancestry of fire. This fire, too, burns as passion for all that he does. It is well known across the island of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] that Leifr is a friend to all, and this is further enforced by his following of [[The World/Deities#Tamara\|Tamara]] as a Cleric of the [[zzzzArchive (Notes that have been merged into others)/Folded into Deities/Domains of The Four\|Life Domain]], where he has earned considerable skill as a healer. Though noble-born his intention toward commonfolk has earned him great respect, just as his father before him. 

With his [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Draconic Ancestry]] tied to the element of fire and religious roots set in [[The World/Deities#Tamara\|Tamara]] [[zzzzArchive (Notes that have been merged into others)/Folded into Deities/Domains of The Four\|Domain]] much of Leifr's time is spent travelling between the forest of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall/Dimmafall\|Dimmafall]] and [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]], as well as in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]] and [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Kings Landing/Kings Landing\|Kings Landing]]. It is in these places he spends most of his time and most closely follows religious events, ceremonies and worship. These locations, too, are the places where he is most known by the people, some of whom he has formed a strong connection with in spite of social standing. 

Since the rule of [[The World/People of the World/Enemies/King Francis Roberts\|King Francis Roberts]], Leifr's public visibility has reduced significantly, he has not been seen at all within the last 2 years. 

It is known that during the time leading up to his disappearance he was known to provide support, both medically and financially, to those who need it, whether [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]], [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Humans/Humans of Q'ba\|Humans of Q'ba]] or [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Non-Human/Non-Human\|Non-Human]]. His non-preferential treatment of all races left some treating him with distain, whether they considered themselves to be aligned with [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]] or otherwise.
