Buster is a Human who works for [[The World/Regional Authorities/Whole Island/The Crown Guard/The Crown Guard\|The Crown Guard]] as a [[The World/Regional Authorities/Whole Island/The Crown Guard/Melee/Drekaplata\|Drekaplata]]. However, he is a friend of [[The World/People of the World/Allies/Q'ba/Draxis Bhann\|Draxis Bhann]] and a non-human sympathiser. He is aware that [[The World/People of the World/Allies/Q'ba/Draxis Bhann\|Draxis Bhann]] has been up to something recently, but is not sure what. What he does know is that whatever it is, it should make things better for non-humans on the island. 

To this end, he has been keeping [[The World/People of the World/Allies/Q'ba/Draxis Bhann\|Draxis Bhann]] notified of recent ongoings with regards to [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]], including the fact that there are currently four factions arming to make a play on the city.
