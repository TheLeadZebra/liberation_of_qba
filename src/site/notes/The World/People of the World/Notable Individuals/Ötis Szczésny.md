Ötis Szczésny (OH-tis SHCHENSH-nih) is a Goliath from [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Astilabors Peak/Settlements/Cień Góry\|Cień Góry]]. Often a winner at the dice table, he got fed up of eating fish and moved into [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]].

While certainly not a noble by definition, he moves in similar circles with the wealth he has acquired. That being said, his favourite tables to play at tend to be in locations where desperation outweighs wealth - a family heirloom or a paupers last copper is always more exciting than another handful gold off the top of a mountain.

A clean white shirt tucked into fancy trousers are Ötis's clothes of choice, though the shirt is always fully unbuttoned showing off his pale skin underneath.

It is known that he had a run-in with a strange, robed woman and a courier inside [[The World/Stores/Taverns & Inns/Taverns & Inns - By Location/Drakenholm/The Bread Forge/The Early Riser\|The Early Riser]] after playing some dice. While patrons did not overhear any names, Ötis was noted to spend some time [[xxDMs Notes/NOT FOR PLAYERS/Character Consequences/Ötis and Yda\|pondering after they left.]]
