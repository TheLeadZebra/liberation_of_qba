> Last night an attempt was made on The Crown Francis Roberts' life. Fortunately The Crown remains unharmed.
> Investigations are ongoing, but as of now it is not believed that the perpetrator was part of any groups, and as such this event is thought to be a one-off. However, due to a concern for public safety a lockdown has been called across the city. This means that no one may enter or leave the city unless they have licence to do so, such as for established traders. However, all licences must be applied for.
> For access into the city, please get in contact with your local authority. If you already are within the city please contact the office of The Speaker, Iddy O'Sue. 
 >During this time there is a risk that that necessary supplies may be limited. As such all individuals will be provided with ration books in order to claim only their alloted amount of food and fuel.
> Further to this a curfew has been placed in effect within Drakenholm, citizens are expected to be off of the streets between the hours of 9pm to 7am. Anyone found to be in breach of the curfew will be given a single caution before being detained. Any persons undergoing suspicious activities will be immediately detained.
