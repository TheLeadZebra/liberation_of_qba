A Dryad, also known as a Wood Nymph or Tree Spirit, are [[Fey\|Fey]] creatures who appear as beautiful young women with [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Non-Human/Elves of Q'ba\|Elves of Q'ba]]-like qualities, their skin is seen to be made of a soft wood and their hair made of leaves or foliage. Much like the trees they change colour with the seasons. A Dryad is born from a tree, to which it is spiritually bound. These trees grow from both as seeds or eggs depending on who you ask. For this reason they are known to be powerful protectors of the forests, especially those that they live within. 

The tree to which a Dryad is bound is also a Dryad's life-force. If the tree is cut down or destroyed then the Dryad too will die soon after. If a Dryad travells too far from their spirit tree, again they will die after a short time has passed, however, if a Dryad spellcaster is able to enchant an acorn from the Dryad's bonded tree with Acorn of Far Travel then she can remain in contact with the tree at all times, regardless of distance, and can therefore travel great distances without becoming sick.
