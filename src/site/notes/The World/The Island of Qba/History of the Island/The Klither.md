The island of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] is inflicted with an unknown affliction, known as the Klither. 

The Klither causes intentional planar travel to become impossible, and arcane or divine abilities which affect other planes become Wild Magic, which may cause a spells effect to become random rather than intentional.

The name derives from the draconic word for Buzzing, because extradimensional spaces (Such as inside a Bag of Holding, or created by Rope Trick) are plagued by an incessant, blaring buzzing sound.

##### Effects
The most common example are summoning spells, for example [[zzRules/DnD 5.5e Rules/04) Backlink Glossary/Spells/Level 1/Find Familiar\|Find Familiar]] (excluding [[zzRules/DnD 5.5e Rules/04) Backlink Glossary/Classes/Druid/Druid\|Druid]] ability), which will bring forth a random spirit every time it is cast rather than a specific one.

However, in the case that a spell does not have a random nature, the spell may instead become Wild, bringing the intended effect along with a random extra effect.

Beyond this, extradimensional spaces work as intended, but the space within has a constant, ongoing buzzing sound.

Further, whilst intentional planar travel is not possible there are rumours of accidental planar travel, not unlike a child passing through a doorway to the Faewild. Beyond rumour there are known cases of pocket dimensions appearing for a time across the island, seemingly irregular in timing and location. Those who dared to travel beyond either have not returned, or spoke of monstrosities beyond the veil.
