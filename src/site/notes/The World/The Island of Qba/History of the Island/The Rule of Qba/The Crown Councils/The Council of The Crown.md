The Council of The Crown is the name given to the advisors of [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]], the ruler of the island of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]]. Traditionally the council consists of three members, known as [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Traditions/The Three\|The Three]]. The individuals who make up The Three have no predefined rules or roles, at any time [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]] may choose to instate, remove or replace any member of The Three, and each member could take on a previous role or have a role completely unique to their tenure. 

For Example, within [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Councils/The Council of Emperor Ygerdern the Golden\|The Council of Emperor Ygerdern the Golden]] it is known that Thruumb Hugsi was given the title "Envoy to the Common Folk", to focus on [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/Previous Rulers/Emperor Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern's]] aim of including the common folk into his decision making, as well as providing them with as good a life as possible. By decree, however, [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/Previous Rulers/Emperor Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Ygerdern]] had the right to remove Thruumb from this post and reinstate someone else to the position, or else create a new title altogether, for instance if a greater focus on island security was now required.
