The Island of Q'ba is home to [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] as a native species, as well as a few other races who have settled upon the island in small numbers over the most recent few hundred years. These races are now split into their own categories of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Humans/Humans of Q'ba\|Humans of Q'ba]] who are very recent settlers, and [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Non-Human/Non-Human\|Non-Human]] which includes any sentient race that is neither [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] or [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Humans/Humans of Q'ba\|Humans of Q'ba]]. 

The island itself is geographically not very large, and yet contains a wide range of biomes (Frost bound mountains, Acid Marshes, Luscious Forest and Scorching Desert) which split among the cardinal directions of the island. Each of these four directions is it's own region, as well as the island's city, [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]], and it's trade port, [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Kings Landing/Kings Landing\|Kings Landing]], each being designated their own region.

Q'ba is an independent state, complete with it's own ruler - [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]], currently [[Story/People/Enemies/King Francis Roberts\|King Francis Roberts]] who was in charge of a research expedition of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Humans/Humans of Q'ba\|Humans]] to the island around 40 years ago. This was the first known contact with humans for the island, who were accepted as settlers on the island by [[The World/People of Note/Rulers/Emperor Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta\|Emperor Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta]]. Since this time there has been a significant sharing of technology and knowledge, in areas such as building, farming and medicine. This lead to a boom in habitant capacity across the island, especially for the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Humans/Humans of Q'ba\|Humans]] who now make up the largest portion of population on the island, overtaking even the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]].

Q'ba is also known by it's population for the large variety of homebrewed or imported alcoholic beverages, with each region having their own, distinct menus, including each district of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]]. Further to this, the whole island comes together to serve the same special option, which changes daily.

#### The Klither
For as long as anyone has known the island, it has been under the effects of a mysterious affliction known as [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Klither\|The Klither]], affecting any and all planar travel and effects, as well as producing doorways to pocket dimensions of unknown origin and fraught with peril.
