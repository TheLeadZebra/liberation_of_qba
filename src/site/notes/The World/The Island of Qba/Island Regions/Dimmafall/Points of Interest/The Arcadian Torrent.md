The Arcadian Torrent is the name given to a waterfall of legend within the forests of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall/Dimmafall\|Dimmafall]]. 

Though no one has been able to prove its existence, there are numerous people who claim to have seen it. Mysteriously, when they try to lead others to visit, they are unable to locate it again.

The waterfall is rumoured to pour out of the air itself, and does not create a river by which to trace it. 

The alleged beauty of such a mystical landmark amongst the forests of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall/Dimmafall\|Dimmafall]] is equally attributed to both the Draconic goddess [[The World/Deities#Tamara\|Tamara]] and the Celestial Plane of Arcadia, though, even those who subscribe to this theory believe that it is through [[The World/Deities#Tamara\|Tamara]]'s grace that such a wonder may come to exist on the island.
