The forest region of Dimmafall is known across the island for its beauty across the whole of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]]. It is the region bonded with [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Green Dragonborn]] and tied to the [[The World/Deities/Deities\|Deities]] [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Tamara\|Tamara]]. Dimmafall also includes the largest town on the island, [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall/Settlements/Kindlewood\|Kindlewood]], which is nestled against the forest as a backdrop, but sits proudly outside of it's boundary. 

The density of the forest combined with the general population of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn's]] indifference to documenting the island's history mean that much of it's flora and fauna remains uncatalogued, though more recently small, [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Humans/Humans of Q'ba\|Humans of Q'ba]] groups have begun to do so as part of their island research. 

Within the forest dwell an [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Non-Human/Elves of Q'ba\|Elven]] Druid Circle who settled on the island little over 100 years ago after travelling the world, including many [[The World/The World Beyond Qba/Toril/Far-Off Lands/Far-Off Lands\|Far-Off Lands]], yet happening upon [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] during a rest-stop between known locations. In Dimmafall they found such beauty that they planted seeds of [[zzRules/DnD Basic Rules (SRD)/03) Monsters/Dryad\|Dryad]] in honour, and decided to remain on the island, creating a settlement known as [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall/Settlements/Circe\|Circe]].

Rumour has it that within the forest there is a mystical waterfall which flows from thin air and does not flow out of the forest. Yet this has never been documented by any who went looking.

The forest region of Tamara, home to the town of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall/Settlements/Kindlewood\|Kindlewood]] and inhabited by [[zzRules/DnD Basic Rules (SRD)/03) Monsters/Dryad\|Dryads]].  The forest has a mystical waterfall which seems to appear from a haze of fog and mist.

To the west of the forest, along the cliffside wall of the island live a group of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Kobolds of Q'ba\|Kobolds of Q'ba]] who keep to themselves but are very territorial against outsiders. Their cliffside bastion is referred to as [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall/Settlements/Kobold Cove\|Kobold Cove]].

To the east is the village of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Dimmafall/Settlements/Leevithkirk\|Leevithkirk]], with a shrine to [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Tamara\|Tamara]]. Those who live here try to spread her blessings into the swamplands of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Stillwater Mire/Stillwater Mire\|Stillwater Mire]].
