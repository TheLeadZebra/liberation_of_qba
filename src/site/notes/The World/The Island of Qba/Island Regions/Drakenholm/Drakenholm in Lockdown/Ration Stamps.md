The city of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]] is in lockdown. Whilst supply caravans have the ability to enter the city, they are restricted.
In order to make sure that supplies in the city do not dwindle a Rations book has been created and distributed.

#### Food Rations
###### Basic Food
Individuals have enough ration stamps to get 1 pound of Basic Food per day. Basic Food consists of rice or bread, dried or cured meat such as ham or bacon, fats, biscuits, preserves and other similar items.
**A day's Basic Food costs 5 silver pieces.**

###### Fresh Food
Individuals also have access to Fresh Food ration stamps, enough for two per week. Fresh Food rations allow access to up to a half pound total of fresh meat, cheeses and other such foods.
**Exchanging a Fresh Food stamp costs 1 gold piece.**

###### Fuel
Houses require fuel in the winter to keep them warm.
A household gets enough stamps to barely heat their home for one day per stamp.

###### Clothing
Clothing is not officially rationed, however supplies of fabrics and other clothes making materials can be in short supply. Some clothiers are likely to withhold providing to those who are not willing to pay for the demand.
