Beggars Gate is the entryway district of the city of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]]. Here city guards defend large gates, and check any traders entering the city for contraband or trespassers. 

This district is the poorest, with tents set up on the interior and exterior of the city walls, filled with citizens who have nowhere else to live. Many of those that live in the conditions of squalor are [[zzRules/DnD Basic Rules (SRD)/04) Backlink Glossary/Species/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] who have fallen victim to poverty since the introduction of non-human tax increases. Very few are [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Humans/Humans of Q'ba\|Human]].

A centrepiece of the plaza is a large [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Points of Interest/Statue of Greenscale\|Statue of Greenscale]], cast in [[The World/Regional Specialisms/Q'ban Anodised Titanium\|green anodised titanium]].
