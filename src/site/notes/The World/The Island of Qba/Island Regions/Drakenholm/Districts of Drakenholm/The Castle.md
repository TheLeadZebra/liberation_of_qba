The Castle, a spire structure which sits within the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Military District\|Military District]] of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]] in [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]]. Home to [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]], and heavily protected by [[The World/Regional Authorities/Whole Island/The Crown Guard/The Crown Guard\|The Crown Guard]]. The building also contains a handful of governing spaces such as a council room and throne room, which doubles as a court room. The Castle also connects to the City Barracks, Jail and Dungeons as part of the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Military District\|Military District]].

The building itself is covered completely in a pattern of dragon scale-like components which glimmer in the sky light. The colour of this glimmer is almost unique depending on your angle of viewing and the time of day, or even during the night if the moon is particularly bright in the sky. 

The Castle represents power and opulence, sitting at the highest part of the city and reaching taller than anything else on the island except for the mountain of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Astilabors Peak/Astilabors Peak\|Astilabors Peak]]. The Castle was built in the image of all dragon kind, it's height a symbol to the gods.
