The White Gardens District, colloquially known as the Upper Quarters, is a district of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]], is home to the majority of [[Story/Factions/Nobles\|Nobles]] on the island of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]]. Here the houses rise higher than any other district in the city, though they are not considered quite as grand as the houses that sit along [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Dragonhill Mile\|Dragonhill Mile]] despite those being shorter in stature. Roads in this district are far wider than any other and space between buildings allows for a feeling of openness.
