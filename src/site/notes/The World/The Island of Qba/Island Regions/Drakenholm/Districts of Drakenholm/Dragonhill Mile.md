Dragonhill Mile is a district of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]] which runs up the centre of the city, connecting [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Beggars Gate\|Beggars Gate]] and the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Military District\|Military District]] directly. Though on an incline, this part of the city houses the wealthiest of [[Story/Factions/Nobles\|Nobles]] with the most grandiose houses, though they lack the height of the housing in the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Upper Quarters\|White Gardens]] district. 

These manors focus heavily on the use of glass in their architecture, utilising a very unique material produced on [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] known as [[The World/Regional Specialisms/Q'ban Speciality Materials#Q'ban Dragon Glass\|Dragon Glass]].
