![Drakenholm - Mapped.jpg](/img/user/zzzAttachments/Drakenholm%20-%20Mapped.jpg)
Drakenholm is the main, and only, city on the island of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]], sitting high on a plateau between 30 and 60 feet off of the ground. 

Drakenholm has the highest density of population of any location by a significant margin. Many of the sentient races  on the island at least have small groupings of individuals that live inside the walls of the city, though the main population is humans, followed by [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]]. This mixture of backgrounds has lead to pockets of stylistic variety among the buildings, even within the same districts.

The city itself is home to [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/The Castle\|The Castle]], which is the home of [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]]. [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/The Castle\|The Castle]] sits within the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Military District\|Military District]] and, historically, is where [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Councils/The Council of The Crown\|The Council of The Crown]] convenes in order to advise their leader on ideas about finances, military, etc, as well as the concerns of the general population. Atop the plateau, [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/The Castle\|The Castle]] is the second tallest landmark on the island, behind [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Astilabors Peak/Astilabors Peak\|Astilabors Peak]] which pokes above the city walls to the north.

300 years ago, Drakenholm was the battleground of a [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/Civil War\|Civil War]]. At the time [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]] was passed down through [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Traditions/Succession of The Crown\|Succession]], to a person chosen to be most worthy. Known now only as [[The World/People of the World/Folk Tales/The Just\|The Just]], who was merely a common man who tried to help those in need. This was much to the displeasure of the ruler's son, [[The World/People of the World/Folk Tales/The Greedy\|The Greedy]], who considered himself the rightful heir, and was insulted that he would be found lacking, as a powerful noble. This led to a battle between noble and common folk, and the subsequent damage or destruction of large swathes of the city. Today, a district known as [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Old Town\|Old Town]]  remains the last standing section of the city as it was built by the City Founders. All other districts are built in the location of destroyed or irreparable sections, which have more modern amenities and distinctive style. 

Modern Drakenholm is split among 7 districts, as well as [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/The Castle\|The Castle]], and also includes the farming town of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/Ravenstone Bridge\|Ravenstone Bridge]] which sits below it's plateau to the south-west.
