Drakenholm is the main, and only, city on the island of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]], sitting high on a plateau between 100 and 150 metres off of the ground. The city itself is surrounded by stone walls around 20 metres high.

Drakenholm has the highest density of population of any location by a significant margin. Many of the sentient races  on the island at least have small groupings of individuals that live inside the walls of the city, though the main population is humans, followed by [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]]. This mixture of backgrounds has lead to pockets of stylistic variety among the buildings, even within the same districts.

The city itself is home to [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#The Castle\|The Castle]], which is the home of [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]]. [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#The Castle\|The Castle]] sits within the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#Military District\|Military District]] and, historically, is where [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Councils/The Council of The Crown\|The Council of The Crown]] convenes in order to advise their leader on ideas about finances, military, etc, as well as the concerns of the general population. Atop the plateau, [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#The Castle\|The Castle]] is the second tallest landmark on the island, behind [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Astilabors Peak/Astilabors Peak\|Astilabors Peak]] which pokes above the city walls to the north.

300 years ago, Drakenholm was the battleground of a [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/Civil War\|Civil War]]. At the time [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]] was passed down through [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Traditions/Succession of The Crown\|Succession]], to a person chosen to be most worthy. Known now only as [[The World/People of the World/Folk Tales/The Just\|The Just]], who was merely a common man who tried to help those in need. This was much to the displeasure of the ruler's son, [[The World/People of the World/Folk Tales/The Greedy\|The Greedy]], who considered himself the rightful heir, and was insulted that he would be found lacking, as a powerful noble. This led to a battle between noble and common folk, and the subsequent damage or destruction of large swathes of the city. Today, a district known as [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#Old Town\|Old Town]]  remains the last standing section of the city as it was built by the City Founders. All other districts are built in the location of destroyed or irreparable sections, which have more modern amenities and distinctive style. 

Modern Drakenholm is split among 7 districts, as well as [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#The Castle\|The Castle]], and also includes the farming town of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#Ravenstone Bridge\|Ravenstone Bridge]] which sits below it's plateau to the south-west.

### Beggar's Gate
Beggars Gate is the entryway district of the city of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]]. Here city guards defend large gates, and check any traders entering the city for contraband or trespassers. 

This district is the poorest, with tents set up on the interior and exterior of the city walls, filled with citizens who have nowhere else to live. Many of those that live in the conditions of squalor are [[zzRules/DnD 5.5e Rules/04) Backlink Glossary/Species/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] who have fallen victim to poverty since the introduction of non-human tax increases. Very few are [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Humans/Humans of Q'ba\|Human]].

A centrepiece of the plaza is a large [[zzzzArchive (Notes that have been merged into others)/Folded into Drakenholm/Statue of Greenscale\|Statue of Greenscale]], cast in [[The World/Regional Specialisms/Q'ban Speciality Materials#Q'ban Anodised Titanium\|green anodised titanium]]. 

#### Points of Interest
##### The City Gates
The city gates tower over the borough of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#Beggar's Gate\|#Beggar's Gate]] with the structure being 40metres tall, double the height of the city walls.
The gate itself is a wrought iron portcullis 30ft wide, which is set between two, perfectly smooth stone square pillars which eventually form into an arch, which extend beyond the walls on either side. The external face, above the portcullis, is decorated in the same scales which adorn [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#The Castle\|#The Castle]]. 
Placed atop the gatehouse is a stone sculpture of the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Insignia of the City of Drakenholm\|Insignia of the City of Drakenholm]]


##### Statue of Greenscale
The centrepiece of the Beggar's Gate plaza is the Statue of Greenscale, a Great Work of Art produced by [[The World/People of the World/Artisans/Stor Ondun\|Stor Ondun]].

The statue is 8 foot tall and sits on a plinth 2 foot tall. The statue was created using [[The World/Regional Specialisms/Q'ban Speciality Materials#Q'ban Anodised Titanium\|Anodised Titanium]] and depicts [[The World/People of the World/Rulers/Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta\|Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta]] as [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]]. It was crafted to celebrate his reign, and in memory of the destruction of the [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/History of the Island#Land Ho\|Pirate Attack on Q'ba]].

### Dragonhill Mile
<iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/4j6T2rx8U365lCQpFNaBGL?si=9b2e6f0b7c1f4cf1?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="50%" height="180" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

Dragonhill Mile is a district of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]] which runs up the centre of the city, connecting [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#Beggar's Gate\|Beggar's Gate]] and the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#Military District\|Military District]] directly. Though on an incline, this part of the city houses the wealthiest of [[Story/Factions/Nobles\|Nobles]] with the most grandiose houses, though they lack the height of the housing in the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#White Gardens/Upper Quarters\|White Gardens]] district. 

These manors focus heavily on the use of glass in their architecture, utilising a very unique material produced on [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]] known as [[The World/Regional Specialisms/Q'ban Speciality Materials#Q'ban Dragon Glass\|Dragon Glass]].

### Free Borough
<iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/6HCDfZUcieFBWdpLpKU9Qf?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="50%" height="180" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

Free Borough is a district of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]]. Sitting between [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#Beggar's Gate\|Beggar's Gate]] and [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#Old Town\|Old Town]], and running alongside [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#Dragonhill Mile\|Dragonhill Mile]], Free Borough is the central hub of temples and guilds. All of the island [[The World/Deities\|deities]] have their own temple in the city, as well as any number that exist within their designated [[The World/Deities#The Four Cardinal Gods\|regions]] across [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]].

During times of civil unrest within the last decade, temples to deities considered to align with negative traits within this city have been targeted with assaults and vandalism.

### Military District
The Military District of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]] surrounds [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#The Castle\|The Castle]]. It is the home of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|Q'ba's]] military power, and City Guards and the final defence to any attack aimed to harm [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]]. Places of interest include barracks, the armoury and the City Jail.

### Old Town
<iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/6yvjmOU3S9T8SYUSnW67re?si=uADj3EJyRbO0aoqX0jR0oA&pi=gmuuKguhRyGQbutm_source=generator&theme=0" width="50%" height="180" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
Old Town is a district of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]]. As the name suggests it is the oldest section of the city, having been built at the time of the cities founding. Much of the city, as it stood then, has since been destroyed during a battle over [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown Traditions/Succession of The Crown\|Succession]], Old Town is all that remains. 

The district is considered the [[Story/Factions/Commoners\|Commoners]] district, because of it's age it was not built with the modern levels of population in mind. This has led to many attempts at retrofitting buildings, and filling small spaces and narrow alleys with extra living spaces, leading to the district now seeming overcrowded and labyrinthine.

### Ravenstone Bridge
Ravenstone Bridge is the name of a farming town on the outskirts of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]], it is often included as a district of the city, being so close to it's gate.

### The Bread Forge
<iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/6aB7a1cxVxHvejomxTcvrg?si=c3b8e30e42204727?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="50%" height="180" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

The Bread Forge is the industrial district of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]]. Smoke constantly billows from the chimneys on near every building in sight. The layout of the buildings here is very symmetrical and neat, with many buildings looking identical on the outside save for their signage. As this is one of the rebuilt districts it is well organised and certainly built for purpose.

### The Castle
<iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/4JBvi0bQKNufmgbLBApRUX?si=b03cdb90726a4502?si=bde5e2ac22594cdb?si=c3b8e30e42204727?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="50%" height="180" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

The Castle, a spire structure which sits within the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#Military District\|Military District]] of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]] in [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]]. Home to [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]], and heavily protected by [[The World/Regional Authorities/Whole Island/The Crown Guard/The Crown Guard\|The Crown Guard]]. The building also contains a handful of governing spaces such as a council room and throne room, which doubles as a court room. The Castle also connects to the City Barracks, Jail and Dungeons as part of the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#Military District\|Military District]].

The building itself is covered completely in a pattern of dragon scale-like components which glimmer in the sky light. The colour of this glimmer is almost unique depending on your angle of viewing and the time of day, or even during the night if the moon is particularly bright in the sky. 

The Castle represents power and opulence, sitting at the highest part of the city and reaching taller than anything else on the island except for the mountain of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Astilabors Peak/Astilabors Peak\|Astilabors Peak]]. The Castle was built in the image of all dragon kind, it's height a symbol to the gods.

### White Gardens/Upper Quarters
<iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/4D04yZNZQfZZyxK4kSAewo?si=bde5e2ac22594cdb?si=c3b8e30e42204727?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="50%" height="180" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

The White Gardens District, colloquially known as the Upper Quarters, is a district of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]], is home to the majority of [[Story/Factions/Nobles\|Nobles]] on the island of [[The World/The Island of Qba/The Island of Qba\|The Island of Qba]]. Here the houses rise higher than any other district in the city, though they are not considered quite as grand as the houses that sit along [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#Dragonhill Mile\|Dragonhill Mile]] despite those being shorter in stature. Roads in this district are far wider than any other and space between buildings allows for a feeling of openness.

They are responsible for the day-to-day investigation and prevention of crime, as well as looking after the local jail. Most of the individuals within [[The World/Regional Authorities/Drakenholm/Drekavorthur\|Drekavorthur]] are commoners who have joined as [[The World/Regional Authorities/Drakenholm/Drekavorthur\|Drekavorthur]] with little or no martial training. There are a few, however, who work as higher ranks. They tend to be the ones that lead investigations, and follow up on reports of criminal activities.

Meanwhile, [[The World/Regional Authorities/Whole Island/The Crown Guard/The Crown Guard\|The Crown Guard]] have their headquarters within the [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm#Military District\|Military District]], most of these individuals are much more capable than anyone within [[The World/Regional Authorities/Drakenholm/Drekavorthur\|Drekavorthur]] however [[The World/Regional Authorities/Whole Island/The Crown Guard/The Crown Guard\|The Crown Guard]] tend to focus mainly on the affairs of [[The World/The Island of Qba/History of the Island/The Rule of Qba/The Crown\|The Crown]] and whole island protection than the day-to-day affairs of petty crime.
