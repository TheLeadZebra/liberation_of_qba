The Kindred Redhearts are a nomadic clan of Garyx worshippers that live in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]]. Their exact location often moves regularly, but it tends to be within short distance of any oasis. The oasis itself, known as [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/The Desert/Points of Interest/The Tears of Garyx\|The Tears of Garyx]], often dries up in the blistering sun of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]] and regularly renews itself in a new location during the aggressive lighting and rain storms that occur nightly. 

The Kindred Redhearts live in caravans and out of carts or tents which are easily taken down and reinstated at their new location. Whilst a majority of those that live in the clan are [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Dragonborn of Q'ba]] there are also small numbers of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Humans/Humans of Q'ba\|Humans]], a handful of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Non-Human/Dwarves of Q'ba\|Dwarves]], and a singular [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Non-Human/Tieflings of Q'ba\|Tieflings of Q'ba]].

Whilst [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/The Desert/The Desert\|The Desert]] is does not have many resources to harvest the proximity to [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Kings Landing/Kings Landing\|Kings Landing]] means that there are regular travellers to the camp for trade and entertainment, especially at [[The Travelling Circus\|The Travelling Circus]] Tavern, which is named after the monthly circus event which is put on by the members of the camp.
