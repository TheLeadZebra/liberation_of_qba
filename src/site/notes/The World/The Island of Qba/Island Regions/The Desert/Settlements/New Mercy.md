New Mercy is the newest settlement on the island, put together very quickly with somewhat flimsy looking wooden buildings. The town is built along the singular long road running between [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]] and [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Kings Landing/Kings Landing\|Kings Landing]], with buildings split either side of the road. 

The aim of the town was to generally improve defences and create a quicker response to potential caravan attacks along this critical route.
