The region of Stillwater Mire sits in the east of the island of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Q'ba\|Q'ba]]. Here the area is covered in swathes of marshlands, the soil and waterways here are deeply acidic and yet they teem with life from foliage, trees and brush as well as insects, small critters and more.

There are not many who have settled in this region, those who do are Dragonborn that live in a single town and many are devout followers of [[The World/Deities/The Four Cardinal Gods/Null\|Null]], the deity who rules over Stillwater Mire, who is the god of Death, and of Dead Dragons. 

Recently word has spread of a group of [[The World/Island Races/Human/Human\|Humans]] who are trying to terraform the region to allow a greater amount of farmland on the island.

The main settlement here is known as [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Stillwater Mire/Settlements/Mirethorp\|Mirethorp]].
