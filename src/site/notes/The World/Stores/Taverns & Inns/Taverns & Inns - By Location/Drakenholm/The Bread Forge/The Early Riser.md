The Early Riser is the name of a Tavern in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm#The Bread Forge\|The Bread Forge]] district of [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Drakenholm\|Drakenholm]]. It also plays the role of a boarding house, with low quality but cheap accommodation for anyone who has moved to the area without a permanent address as of yet.

The building's interior has a distinct collaboration between [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Dragonkin/Dragonborn of Q'ba\|Draconic]] architecture and [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Non-Human/Dwarves of Q'ba\|Dwarven]] design, allowing for a very comfortable and homely feel, combined with open spaces designed to cater to elemental archetypes.

The owner of the Tavern is a [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Races/Non-Human/Dwarves of Q'ba\|Dwarf]] who is hard working and does not have time to join in with conversations that do not interest him, as the clientele here tend to be workers of the industrial sectors coming to take a load off after a hard day of working. He does is not easily threatened and will not tolerate nonsense.
