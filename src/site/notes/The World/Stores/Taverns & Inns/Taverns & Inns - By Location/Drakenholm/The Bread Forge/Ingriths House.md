Ingriths house is the name of a tiny tavern in [[The World/The Island of Qba/Island Regions/Drakenholm/Districts of Drakenholm/The Bread Forge\|The Bread Forge]], pressed up against the city walls on the south side.
There are only three tables with seven chairs in total, and rarely are they ever filled. The clientele of Ingrith's house tend to be the sort that would remain isolated outside of the Tavern's walls, though inside this cosy room conversation tends to flow.

The Tavern consists of only 4 small rooms; the tavern proper with bar and tables, a tiny water closet for when nature calls, a cellar for storing kegs, and a small storage room beside the keg room.
